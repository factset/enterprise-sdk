  description: "\nThe Investment Research API provides a comprehensive set of functionalities\
    \ for searching and retrieving research reports and documents from various contributors.\n\
    \nThis API is designed to expose document search and document retrieval functionality.\
    \ A document search will allow a request to query FactSet document databases based\
    \ on certain search criteria specified in the request.\n\nFactSet collects research\
    \ reports and models from brokers, independent research providers, market research\
    \ firms, rating agencies, and other publishers of research. These documents are\
    \ processed and made available to clients within about two minutes of receipt.\n\
    \nFactSet delivers this content through two main products:\n\n**FactSet Research\
    \ Connect** – real-time research for investment managers entitled by the contributors\
    \ to access the content.\n\n**FactSet Aftermarket Research** – delayed research\
    \ for investment bankers permitted by contributors to purchase the research.\n\
    \nThe meta endpoints namely time-zones, categories, research-contributors, research-analysts,\
    \ security-types and asset-types provide comprehensive lists of data that is used\
    \ in the research endpoints.\n\n  "

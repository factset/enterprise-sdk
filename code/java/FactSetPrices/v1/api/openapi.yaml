          Enables the ability to asynchronously "batch" the request, supporting a long-running request up to **10 minutes**. Upon requesting batch=Y, the service will respond back with an HTTP Status Code of 202.

          **Additional Access Required. To gain access to this feature, reach out to your FactSet Account team or "Report Issue" above and our support teams can assist.**

          Once a batch request is submitted, use `batch/v1/status` to see if the job has completed. Once completed, retrieve the results of the request via `batch/v1/result`.

          When using Batch, `ids` limit is increased to **5000** ids per request, though limits on query string via GET method still apply. It's advised to submit large lists of ids via POST method.

        Gets zero relative date and last update time for FactSet databases. The dates represent the date that the rollover event happened; the date and time is in **eastern time zone**.  <p>Depending on the ids requested and their respective regions, a requested startDate or endDate used in the various Prices API may reflect different previous close dates. This relative "zero" date, meaning - as of yesterday's close - will vary across global regions. This API is designed to help production systems account for regional rollover dates to know when to trigger their processes for different regions to reflect the latest close. The response gives context for AMERICAS, ASIA PACIFIC, and EUROPE. </p>

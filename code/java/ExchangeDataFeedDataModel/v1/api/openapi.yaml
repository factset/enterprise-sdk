  description: FactSetâ€™s Real-time market data products provide access to consolidated
    real-time and delayed global exchange data. Proprietary technology normalizes
    over 250 global venues, 18+ million instruments, and 150+ data fields. Asset types
    integrated include equities, futures, options, warrants, fixed income, mutual
    funds, ETFs, indices, commodities, and FX rates. Innovative technology ensures
    reliability and provides scalability that allows clients to make requests based
    on a symbol list or an exchange. Reduce development time by powering proprietary
    and third-party applications with exchange data from a unified data model. <p>The
    Real-time Data Model API provides mappings for enumerations used in our Real-Time
    DataFeed products and should be used in conjunction with the DataFeed Data Model
    documentation available for each product. <p>The initial version of this API is
    limited to include mapping tables for the product codes and exchanges only.

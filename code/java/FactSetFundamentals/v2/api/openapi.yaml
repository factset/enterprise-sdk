        Retrieves FactSet Fundamentals standardized data for specified securities. Use the ```/metrics``` endpoint to retrieve a full list of valid metrics or data items.


        The ```/fundamentals``` endpoint currently supports Long Running asynchronous requests up to **20 minutes** via batch parameter. Id limit is set to 2000 ids per request when using batch capability and 250 ids without batching. (1 metric per ID, for 1 day in both the cases). This feature is available for all users.

        This endpoint initiates an asynchronous batch job to fetch Point-in-Time (PIT) data. PIT data allows you to view fundamentals data as it was known on a specific date. This is crucial for backtesting trading strategies, performing academic research, and avoiding lookahead bias. All requests will return a `202 Accepted` response with a `Location` header pointing to the `/batch-status` endpoint. Use the `id` from the status response to check for completion and retrieve the result from the `/batch-result` endpoint. **All timestamps are in UTC.**

            The data type for the metric. Make note, mixing data types within a single /fundamentals API is not supported. Each dataType is defined below -
              * **date** - date format expressed in YYYY-MM-DD.
              * **doubleArray** - A double is a FactSet data type, similar to a float or an integer. A double represents numeric data but provides a greater amount of decimal precision than the float data type. Double values have up to 15 digits of precision, while float values have up to 7 digits (integers have up to 10 digits).
              * **float** - A float value is a real number (i.e., a number that can contain a fractional part/decimals). A float value has a precision of up to seven digits and accurately represents numbers whose absolute value is less than 16,277,216 (224). An example metric includes
              * **floatArray** - Function will hold data for multiple periods, as well as for many companies (i.e., two-dimensional value). The FLOATARRAY function returns data using a vertical orientation (e.g., down a column). The difference between FLOAT and FLOATARRAY is that FLOAT can only go across a row (one-dimension; horizontal orientation; vertical length=1) whereas FLOATARRAY will return data both across a row and down a column (two-dimensions; vertical orientation). With FLOATARRAY, the number of data points across a row will correspond to the number of companies queried; the number of data points down a column will correspond to the length of the time series.
              * **intArray** - An integer is a whole number or zero (i.e., integers do not include decimals). Integers can be positive or negative.
              * **string** - A string value is an ASCII character. A string is a sequence of ASCII characters. String value and text value are synonymous. The function will hold data for multiple time periods, as well as for many companies (i.e., two-dimensional value). The STRING_ARRAY function returns data using a vertical orientation (e.g., down a column)
              * **stringArray** - The difference between STRING and STRINGARRAY is that STRING can only go across a row (one-dimension; horizontal orientation; vertical length=1) whereas STRINGARRAY will return data both across a row and down a column (two-dimensions; vertical orientation). With STRINGARRAY, the number of data points across a row will correspond to the number of companies queried; the number of data points down a column will correspond to the length of the time series.

  description: "With global coverage since 1999, the FactSet Estimates API provides\
    \ you with comprehensive estimates and statistics on a wide variety of financial\
    \ statement items as well as industry-specific metrics. The universe is comprised\
    \ of over 19,000 active companies across 90+ countries with the following types\
    \ of data included:\n \n- **Consensus**\n- **Detail**\n- **Ratings**\n- **Surprise**\n\
    - **Segments**\n- **Actuals**\n- **New Estimates and Ratings Reports Endpoints**\n\
    \nFor clients seeking  curated and relevant financial data, the FactSet Estimates\
    \ API now includes Estimates and Ratings Reports endpoints. These powerful endpoints\
    \ are designed for easy integration and consumption, delivering a wide array of\
    \ financial metrics, estimates, and critical statistics in a highly accessible\
    \ format suitable for both mobile and web applications.\n \nWhether you are an\
    \ analyst, investor, or financial professional, the Estimates and Ratings Reports\
    \ endpoints offer detailed and actionable financial insights that can support\
    \ thorough analyses and strategic decision-making processes.\n \nThe Estimates\
    \ and Ratings Reports endpoints are especially valuable for B2B2C  applications,\
    \ empowering financial services firms, investment companies, and corporate finance\
    \ teams to:\n \n- **Elevate Client Engagement:** Enrich user experiences in client-facing\
    \ applications with comprehensive and up-to-date financial metrics.\n\n- **Build\
    \ Custom Reporting Tools:** Create tailored dashboards and analytics tools that\
    \ provide deep insights and foster better financial understanding.\n\nBy adopting\
    \ the FactSet Estimates API with its enriched Estimates and Ratings Reports endpoints,\
    \ businesses can streamline their financial data integration process, improve\
    \ operational efficiency, and deliver superior financial insights to their clients\
    \ and end-users.\n    <p>This API is rate-limited to 10 requests per second and\
    \ 10 concurrent requests per user.</p>\n\n**Download API Specification**\n   \

      description: |
        Returns FactSet Estimates consensus data using rolling fiscal dates. <p>The rolling behavior causes fiscal year to automatically roll from one year to the next as the historical perspective date changes. The fiscal period rolls forward as of each period end. This endpoint is optimized to allow the request to simply include a relative fiscal period (e.g. use relativeFiscalStart integer 1 and periodicity ANN for next unreported fiscal year end), and then see what the consensus thought the "next fiscal year" estimates were through time as you "roll" back your perspective dates. This differs from locking down an absolute estimate period such as explicitly stating Fiscal Year 2019. This can be done in the fixed-consensus endpoint.</p>

        Returns FactSet Estimates consensus data using fixed fiscal dates. For example, if the company's current unreported year is 12/2020, all data returned by formulas that specify as the period/report basis will be for 12/2005 regardless of what perspective dates (startDate/endDate) are used. The fixed dates are "locked" in time and all estimated values are for that explicit date. If you are requesting that the estimated periods can change with the perspective date, please use the rolling-consensus endpoint.

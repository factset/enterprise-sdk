# InlineResponse2003DataMaximumYield

Maximum yield based on the ask price.  It represents a hypothetical maximum payout at maturity minus the ask price of the derivative. This key figure represents a theoretically possible best-case scenario, disregarding the probability of occurrence. It is calculated only for securitized derivatives with a limited payout (e.g. capped products).

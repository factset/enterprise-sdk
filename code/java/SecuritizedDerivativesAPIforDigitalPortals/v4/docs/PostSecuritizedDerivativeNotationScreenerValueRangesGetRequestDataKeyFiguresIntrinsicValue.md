# PostSecuritizedDerivativeNotationScreenerValueRangesGetRequestDataKeyFiguresIntrinsicValue

Value range of the intrinsic value. It represents the difference between the underlying level and the strike of the securitized derivative, adjusted for the cover ratio and the currency cross rate. If the difference is negative, the intrinsic value is given as 0. The intrinsic value represents the theoretical profit from an immediate exercise of the derivative. This key figure is calculated for plain vanilla warrants only.

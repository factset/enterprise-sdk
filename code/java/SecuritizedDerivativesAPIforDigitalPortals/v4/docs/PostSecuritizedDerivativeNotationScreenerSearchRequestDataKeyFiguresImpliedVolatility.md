Value range of the implied volatility. It represents the volatility of the underlying that justifies the ask price of the derivative, when used as a parameter in the derivative's pricing model (such as Black - Scholes). Its value is a result of the pricing process, thus it represents the annual volatility of the underlying expected by the market participants until maturity of the derivative. This key figure is calculated for plain vanilla warrants only.

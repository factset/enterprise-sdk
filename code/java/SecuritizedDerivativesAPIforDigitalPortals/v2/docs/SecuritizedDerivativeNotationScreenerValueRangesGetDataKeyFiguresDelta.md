# SecuritizedDerivativeNotationScreenerValueRangesGetDataKeyFiguresDelta

Delta. It represents the first partial derivative of the function determining the derivative notation's theoretical price with respect to the underlying level, evaluated at the underlying level. Delta indicates the ratio of the absolute change of the price of a derivative for an indefinitely small absolute change in the underlying level, thus it represents the price sensitivity of the derivative relative to changes in the underlying level. This key figure is calculated for plain vanilla warrants only.

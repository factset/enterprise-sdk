  description: "### OVERVIEW\n\nThe FactSet Conversational API allows clients to integrate\
    \ core FactSet Mercury capabilities in chatbot experiences.\n\nThe Conversational\
    \ API is powered by FactSet Mercury, FactSet's Generative Artificial Intelligence\
    \ (GenAI) large language model. The Conversational API provides a variety of content\
    \ and capabilities, including FactSet’s Federation layer (FactSet’s core GenAI-based\
    \ technology), as well as more specific content and functionality tailored for\
    \ financial services workflows.\n\nThe Conversational API provides answers to\
    \ hundreds of natural language search queries and allows you to easily ask questions\
    \ related to companies and markets research.\n\nSome example supported prompts:\n\
    \n- Nintendo's highest closing stock price over the last 3 months\n- Has Yelp\
    \ issued any guidance?\n- What are the key trends impacting costs for DaVita?\n\
    \n**For Information on Access to and Content Available via the Conversational\
    \ API**\n\nPlease see the [Conversational API Online Assistant Page](https://my.apps.factset.com/oa/pages/23209).\
    \ Here you can find instructions on how to set up access to the Conversational\
    \ API, and the full list of content available.\n\n#### Conversational API Consumer\
    \ Workflow\n\nThe Conversational API is an asynchronous API that utilizes status\
    \ polling to inform the consumer when a query response is complete. Please see\
    \ the technical OpenAPI documentation below for specific information regarding\
    \ consuming the API programmatically.\n\nAt a high level, the API consumer workflow\
    \ is as follows:\n\n1) Send a natural language query to the `/query` endpoint\
    \ and start the response generation process.\n2) Poll the status of the response\
    \ generation process using the `/status` endpoint.\n3) Once the status indicates\
    \ a ready response, retrieve it using the `/result` endpoint. \n- If your response\
    \ contains a file ID, such as for an Excel chart or a [FactSet ActiveGraph](https://my.apps.factset.com/oa/pages/20355),\
    \ retrieve it using the file ID at the `/download/file` endpoint.\n- To provide\
    \ feedback on your response and help the Conversational API better serve you content,\
    \ we encourage you to use the `/feedback` endpoint. \n\n#### Receive updates on\
    \ changes to the Conversational API\nSubscribe to our FactSet Notify by clicking\
    \ \"Subscribe to notifications\" in the upper right above the API overview. You\
    \ will receive email updates when any updates occur to the API\n\n#### FAQ & Troubleshooting\n\
    Please find FAQs and troubleshooting tips in the [FAQs section](https://my.apps.factset.com/oa/pages/23440)\
    \ of the Conversational API OA page\n\n##### Current Limitations\n\n- \"Natural\
    \ language\" in this documentation refers to modern conversational English. Support\
    \ for other languages is currently unavailable.\n- The Conversational API is currently\
    \ limited to accept 10 natural language queries per minute and 200 per hour for\
    \ an individual consumer. If you anticipate your needs to be greater than these\
    \ limits, please reach out to FactSet Support.\n"

        Use this endpoint to send a natural language query to FactSet Mercury, our large language model for surfacing FactSet datasets through conversational natural language queries.
        A request to `/query` will initiate the response generation process for the given query. Queries can be sent as standalone questions or as part of a conversational message chain, using a chat ID to maintain context.

        Responses from `/query` contain the following:
        * **jobId**: used in subsequent endpoints to poll the status of response generation and retrieve the response from FactSet Mercury.
        * **chatId**: optionally used to ask further questions in the same conversational message chain.

        Please see the [Conversational API Online Assistant page](https://my.apps.factset.com/oa/pages/23209) for details around available content and types of questions the Conversational API can answer.

        Use this endpoint to retrieve the status of a chat response for a given chat job ID (received from the `/query` endpoint). Poll the `/status` endpoint with your job ID to confirm when your data is ready.

        Answers may take minutes to generate, depending on the complexity of the query.

        Returns a 202 status code if the response is still processing, and a 201 status code if the response is ready.

                content: 'Q&A Summary (Call Time: 21-Sep-23 11:00 ET): Management
                  is bullish on the wealth space, seeing opportunities in adjacent
                  workflows and expecting growth despite pressure across most firm
                  types. Guidance for 2024 anticipates similar growth on the buy side,
                  slower growth in banking, acceleration in wealth, and a more constructive
                  environment in the partners business. Price realization improved
                  across workstation packages in 2023, contributing to the 2024 outlook.
                  However, impact from price increases is expected to be less than
                  in 2023. Adjusted operating margin guidance for 2024 is ahead of
                  2025 expectations, with potential margin expansion driven by workforce,
                  real estate, and third-party data growth control. GenAI is expected
                  to improve client experience and drive new desktops, with potential
                  for new products and off-platform opportunities. Some GenAI products
                  are expected to come to market in 2024. Employee count growth is
                  expected to continue at about 5% in 2024, with the majority of hires
                  in centers of excellence. Expense growth in 2024 is expected to
                  be heavier towards the back half of the year, particularly in Q4.

                  deep sector, private markets and the technology investment we're
                  making now around generative AI, I think there's a massive opportunity
                  for us not just across banking, but across some of the smaller firm
                  types that we deal with like private equity, corporates and even
                  hedge funds where we may not have played as much in the past. So
                  I think we're set up very nicely here. And I think when the market
                  turns, I think we'll really be able to capitalize on this.

                content: Hi, Ashish. It's Helen. Thank you for that question. I think
                  from our perspective, I don't want to say we've hit a bottom. That's
                  too strong of a word. But when I think about this year and last
                  year, I would expect that two things to happen. One is that the
                  erosion reduction will actually be more leveled off, and I think
                  that's an important thing to sort of keep in mind. Banking isn't
                  – is key, but we actually grew the number of seats in banking overall.
                  Please keep in mind that part of that isn't just around the clients
                  that we have, but the new clients that we win, and we have a couple
                  of very good opportunities. So we look at that as part of our –
                  when we talk to firm type. The second is pricing, which in the past,
                  I think we've talked about a third, a third, a third. I think from
                  a pricing perspective, it actually added more this year from a percent
                  basis than in the past. We see it continuing to add in 2024 although
                  closer back down to maybe 1/4 or less than 1/3. And I think that's
                  probably more of the – a bit of a headwind that I would look to
                  than necessarily just thinking about seats. So, that's how I would
                  take a look at some of the – what's built into our guidance.

                content: Hey, Alex, it's Helen. Yeah, I'm happy to try to answer that
                  question, so thank you. You're right, we're early in the year but
                  we have greater visibility, of course, in our first half, so I'll
                  talk to that specifically. We are expecting current market conditions
                  in the first half – I'm going to go by firm type here – so when
                  you talk about buy-side, we actually finished the year quite strong
                  with both asset owners and hedge funds. So, the three things that
                  we see right now in the pipeline is, one, we're continuing to gain
                  traction in the middle office, so building off of some of the great
                  wins we had in the asset servicing space, we would expect that to
                  continue. Second, we're seeing strong demand in the data feeds business,
                  so, both for company data as well as our data management solutions,
                  where we're really leveraging the strength of our concordance for
                  content for clients. We had two significant wins, one in real-time,
                  one in  tech data (00:34:57), both displacing competitors. And a
                  result, we're getting inbound discussions around that. So, that's
                  also filling up our pipeline. And then third, as Phil mentioned
                  earlier, the strength in offerings we have in the front office are
                  also gaining traction, part of our GenAI enhancements. We'll be
                  supporting that.

                content: Yeah. We feel good about the 6% to 8%, Manav. That's why
                  we put it out there. I think if we break it down by firm type, we
                  anticipate doing about the same level of growth on the buy-side
                  as we did this year. And as you know, we've been evolving into more
                  of a solutions provider for our clients. So, despite head count
                  pressure, which we certainly did see on the buy-side, we still think
                  there's a great opportunity to take market share. We are anticipating
                  slower growth within banking. There are some things in the pipeline
                  that I think Helen might be able to speak to, but we're not anticipating
                  a blockbuster hiring year in banking as part of our algorithm. We
                  just spoke about Wealth, so we're definitely anticipating some acceleration
                  on the Wealth side. And then in the Partners part of our business,
                  which we're now separating out a bit, we're expecting a more constructive
                  environment there. We actually had – it wasn't a great year for
                  us in that part of the business. I'm not talking about CGS, CUSIP.
                  I'm talking about the rest of the Partners business. So, Helen,
                  do you want give some more commentary on the pipeline?

In addition, the introduction of AI technologies, particularly generative AI, into new or existing offerings may result in new or expanded risks and liabilities, due to enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny, litigation, compliance issues, ethical concerns, confidentiality, data privacy or security risks, as well as other factors that could adversely affect our business, reputation, and financial results. For example, use of AI technologies could lead to unintended consequences, such as accuracy issues, cybersecurity risks, unintended biases, and discriminatory outputs, could impact our ability to protect our data, intellectual property, and client information, or could expose us to intellectual property claims by third parties.
                  Strategy & Market Demand Risks
                  Competition in our industry may cause price reductions or loss of market share
                  We continue to experience intense competition across all markets for our products, with competitors ranging in size from smaller, highly specialized, single-product businesses to multi-billion-dollar companies. While we believe the breadth and depth of our suite of products and applications offer benefits to our clients that are a competitive advantage, our competitors may offer price incentives to attract new business. Future competitive pricing pressures may result in decreased sales volumes and price reductions, resulting in lower revenues and ASV. Weak economic conditions may also result in clients seeking to utilize lower-cost information that is available from alternative sources. The impact of cost-cutting pressures across the industries we serve could lower demand for our products. Clients within the financial services industry that strive to reduce their operating costs may seek to reduce their spending on financial market data and related services, such as ours. If our clients consolidate their spending with fewer suppliers, by selecting suppliers with lower-cost offerings or by self-sourcing their needs for financial market data, our business could be negatively affected.
                  The continued shift from active to passive investing could negatively impact user count growth and revenues
                  The predominant investment strategy today is still active investing, which attempts to outperform the market. The main advantage of active management is the expectation that the investment managers will be able to outperform market indices.

                content: 'Q&A Summary (Call Time: 21-Mar-24 11:00 ET): Client activity
                  is picking up, with increased pressure on headcount and strength
                  in enterprise solutions and platform solutions. Expect a healthier
                  pipeline in H2 versus H1, with higher deal volume. The pipeline
                  is stronger than last year, with half coming from the buy side.
                  Managed services represent a smaller part of the business but offer
                  good opportunities for clients to outsource solutions to FactSet.
                  Growth in price increase was $25M this quarter, in line with FY
                  2022, although lower than FY 2023. Total new business ASV has increased
                  due to higher new logos. Expenses are expected to ramp up through
                  the calendar year, leading to lower margins in Q3 and Q4 compared
                  to Q1 and Q2. A large number of seven-figure deals are present in
                  the pipeline. Despite pressure on headcount, there''s an opportunity
                  for growth by tying front office to middle office operations. The
                  company anticipates lower organic ASV growth and GAAP revenue at
                  the lower end of guidance due to factors like CS-UBS merger impact
                  and a large Wealth cancelation event. This summary was generated
                  using LLM technology optimized by StreetAccount. FactSet owns StreetAccount,
                  the publisher of this content.'

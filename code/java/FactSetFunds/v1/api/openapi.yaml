        Fetch basic fund classification data, such as Asset Class, Category, Focus, Niche, Region, and more.<p> FactSet Mutual Funds Reference uses FactSet's proprietary Fund Classification System, which categorizes funds using a rules-based system that is derived from seven core classifications. This system evaluates the asset class, economic development level, and geographical region as described in each fund's prospectus and marketing materials. Fund exposure details are presented on successively granular levels- category, then focus, and then niche. Moreover, FactSet Fund Reference captures over 40 unique data points for U.S. mutual funds. All data items are grouped in one of two levels, either as a Fund or as a Share Class.</p><p>For more details regarding FactSet's Fund Classification, visit Online Assistant [21436](https://my.apps.factset.com/oa/pages/21436) or download - [FactSet Fund Classification System Rules & Methodology](https://my.apps.factset.com/oa/cms/oaAttachment/4547a2f4-5df5-4ec9-a0d3-7d51610dd637/26837)</p><p>

        |Category|The 1st of 3 asset-class-specific, hierarchical exposure tiers; the broadest category the fund falls under within its asset class (e.g., Size & Style, Sector, Precious Metals, Absolute Returns); based on the fund's mandate.|
        |Focus|The 2nd of 3 asset-class-specific, hierarchical exposure tiers; the fund's classification within its category (e.g. Small Cap, Energy, Palladium, Long/Short); based on the fund's mandate.|
        |Niche|The 3rd of 3 asset-class-specific, hierarchical exposure tiers; The fund's classification within its Focus. Most granular tier of exposure sort (e.g., Growth, Coal, Physically held, Merger Arbitrage); based on the fund's mandate.|
        |Economic Development Level|The country development level of the fund (Developed, Emerging, Frontier, or Blended) based on the fund's mandate.|
        |Region|The broad regional exposure of the fund (e.g., Latin America, Asia-Pacific, Global) based on the fund's mandate.|
        |Specific Geography|The specific geographic exposure of the fund (e.g., Developed Europe, Chile, Asia-Pacific Ex-Japan) based on the fund's mandate.|

        Fetch basic fund classification data, such as Asset Class, Category, Focus, Niche, Region, and more.<p> FactSet Mutual Funds Reference uses FactSet's proprietary Fund Classification System, which categorizes funds using a rules-based system that is derived from seven core classifications. This system evaluates the asset class, economic development level, and geographical region as described in each fund's prospectus and marketing materials. Fund exposure details are presented on successively granular levels- category, then focus, and then niche. Moreover, FactSet Fund Reference captures over 40 unique data points for U.S. mutual funds. All data items are grouped in one of two levels, either as a Fund or as a Share Class.</p><p>For more details regarding FactSet's Fund Classification, visit Online Assistant [21436](https://my.apps.factset.com/oa/pages/21436) or download - [FactSet Fund Classification System Rules & Methodology](https://my.apps.factset.com/oa/cms/oaAttachment/4547a2f4-5df5-4ec9-a0d3-7d51610dd637/26837)</p><p>
        |Classification Type|Description|

        |Category|The 1st of 3 asset-class-specific, hierarchical exposure tiers; the broadest category the fund falls under within its asset class (e.g., Size & Style, Sector, Precious Metals, Absolute Returns); based on the fund's mandate.|
        |Focus|The 2nd of 3 asset-class-specific, hierarchical exposure tiers; the fund's classification within its category (e.g. Small Cap, Energy, Palladium, Long/Short); based on the fund's mandate.|
        |Niche|The 3rd of 3 asset-class-specific, hierarchical exposure tiers; The fund's classification within its Focus. Most granular tier of exposure sort (e.g., Growth, Coal, Physically held, Merger Arbitrage); based on the fund's mandate.|
        |Economic Development Level|The country development level of the fund (Developed, Emerging, Frontier, or Blended) based on the fund's mandate.|
        |Region|The broad regional exposure of the fund (e.g., Latin America, Asia-Pacific, Global) based on the fund's mandate.|
        |Specific Geography|The specific geographic exposure of the fund (e.g., Developed Europe, Chile, Asia-Pacific Ex-Japan) based on the fund's mandate.|

If a vendor does not provide NAV and shares outstanding on a market holiday, the previous trading day value is used. If a vendor does provide data on a market holiday, that value will be presented, and then fund flows and AUM will be calculated. When you are manually calculating actual AUM on a market holiday or a rolled date, it will differ from the value shown in the FactSet workstation. This is due to the previous day's NAV being used in the manual AUM calculation.</p>

        Get the Fund Level or Share Class Level Assets Under Management (AUM). <p>NOTE - AUM can be accessed on a five-day calendar. If a vendor does not provide NAV and shares outstanding on a market holiday, the previous trading day value is used. If a vendor does provide data on a market holiday, that value will be presented, and then fund flows and AUM will be calculated. When you are manually calculating actual AUM on a market holiday or a rolled date, it will differ from the value shown in the FactSet workstation. This is due to the previous day's NAV being used in the manual AUM calculation.</p>

          descInfo: The fund seeks capital appreciation and income from an actively
            managed portfolio of US large-cap value stocks.
          fundOfFundsId: null
          inceptionDate: 1977-07-01
          insight: The fund provides narrow exposure to the US large-cap value segment.
            It actively manages a portfolio of 30 to 50 stocks issued by companies
            the adviser believes are undervalued relative to their intrinsic worth.
            The fund emphasizes firms with below average price-to-earnings ratios
            that may pay above average dividends. Eligible companies must also have
            a market capitalization within the range of companies included in the
            Russell 1000 Value Index, a market cap-weighted index of large-cap value
            firms. The portfolio includes common stock, preferred and convertible
            securities, other financial instruments that are components of, or have
            characteristics similar to the securities included in the Russell 1000
            Value Index, as well as American Depositary Receipts (ADRs). Though the
            fund primarily holds US companies, it may invest up to 25% of its total
            assets in foreign issuers.

          name: BlackRock Large Cap Focus Value Fund, Inc - Institutional
          navCurrency: USD
          objective: Under normal circumstances, the Fund seeks to invest at least
            80% of its net assets plus the amount of any borrowings for investment
            purposes in large cap equity securities and derivatives that have similar
            economic characteristics to such securities. For purposes of the Fund’s
            80% policy, large cap equity securities are equity securities that at
            the time of purchase have a market capitalization within the range of
            companies included in the Russell 1000® Value Index (the “Russell 1000
            Value Index”). The Russell 1000 Value Index is a capitalization-weighted
            index from a broad range of industries chosen for market size, liquidity
            and industry group representation. Equity securities consist of common
            stock, preferred stock and convertible securities, other financial instruments
            that are components of, or have characteristics similar to, the securities
            included in the Russell 1000 Value Index, and American Depositary Receipts
            (“ADRs”), which are receipts typically issued by an American bank or trust
            company that evidence underlying securities issued by a foreign company.
            The Fund invests primarily in equity securities that Fund management believes
            are undervalued, which means that their prices are less than Fund management
            believes they are worth. Fund management places particular emphasis on
            companies with below average price/earnings ratios that may pay above
            average dividends. The Fund invests primarily in common stock of U.S.
            companies, but the Fund may invest up to 25% of its total assets in the
            securities of foreign companies and ADRs. The Fund generally intends to
            invest in not less than 30 to not more than 50 companies.

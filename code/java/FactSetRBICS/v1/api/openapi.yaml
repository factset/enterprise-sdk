    FactSet Revere Business Industry Classification System (RBICS) is a comprehensive structured taxonomy to classify companies by what they primarily do. It delivers a granular view for investors by classifying companies using a bottom-up approach according to the products and services they provide. By combining this approach with a top-level grouping based on companies' behavior similarities and stock co-movement, FactSet RBICS delivers unprecedented precision for 1,400+ sector groups.

    RBICS Focus is a six level classification which highlights the companys main business. It is based on the company business line/s that stand for majority of a the revenue that the company generates. Updated monthly.

        Understand the full RBICS Taxonomy Structure through time to help organize your analysis or facilitate the use of RBICS in application development.

        Designed to overcome disparate and non-standardized company disclosures, the RBICS taxonomy is a normalized global industry classification consisting of a fourteen-by-six matrix. There are twelve economies with two specialty sectors, each with six incremental detailed layers, resulting in over 1,600 sector groups.

        The top-levels' market-defined approach groups companies based on their behavioral similarities and stock price co-movement, while the patented product-based approach used in the lower levels enables the necessary precision to capture the specialty sectors of global markets.

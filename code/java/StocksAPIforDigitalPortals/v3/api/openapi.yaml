  description: "The Stocks API features a screener to search for equity instruments\
    \ based on stock-specific parameters.\n\nParameters for up to three fiscal years\
    \ might now be used in one request; data is available for the ten most recent\
    \ completed fiscal years.\nEstimates are available for the current and two consecutive\
    \ fiscal years. Search criteria also include benchmark-related attributes\n(beta,\
    \ correlation, outperformance), and ESG parameters, based on FactSet’s Truvalue\
    \ ESG scores.\n\nA separate endpoint returns the possible values and value ranges\
    \ for the parameters that the endpoint /stock/notation/screener/search accepts\n\
    Application developers can request the values and value ranges only for a restricted\
    \ set of notations that match predefined parameters. This\nfunctionality may be\
    \ used to pre-fill the values and value ranges of the parameters of the /stock/notation/screener/search\
    \ endpoint so that\nperforming a search always leads to a non-empty set of notations.\n\
    \nThe endpoint /stock/notation/ranking/intraday/list ranks stocks notations using\
    \ intraday figures, for example to build a gainers/losers list. \n\nAdditional\
    \ endpoints include end-of-day benchmark key figures, and selected fundamentals\
    \ (as of end of fiscal year and with daily updates).\n\nThis API is fully integrated\
    \ with the corresponding [Quotes API](https://developer.factset.com/api-catalog/quotes-api-digital-portals),\
    \ allowing\naccess to detailed price and performance information of instruments,\
    \ as well as basic security identifier cross-reference. For direct access\nto\
    \ price histories, please refer to the [Time Series API for Digital Portals](https://developer.factset.com/api-catalog/time-series-api-digital-portals).\n\
    \nSimilar criteria based screener APIs exist for fixed income instruments and\
    \ securitized derivatives: See the\n[Bonds API](https://developer.factset.com/api-catalog/bonds-api-digital-portals)\
    \ and the\n[Securitized Derivatives API](https://developer.factset.com/api-catalog/securitized-derivatives-api-digital-portals)\
    \ for details.\n\nSee also the recipe [\"Enrich Your Digital Portal with Flexible\
    \ Equity Screening\"](https://developer.factset.com/recipe-catalog/enrich-your-digital-portal-flexible-equity-screening).\n"

      description: Selected fundamentals for a stock with values as of the end of
        a fiscal year; any other instrument yields empty values for stock-specific
        attributes. The endpoint allows the retrieval of data only for specified fiscal
        years by using the start and end properties. Since a fiscal year and a calendar
        year do not necessarily match with regard to their start and end dates, the
        year is derived as the calendar year occupied to a larger extent by the fiscal
        year, using a June through May fiscal year assignment. That means, fiscal
        years ending from the 1st of June onwards are assigned to the same calendar
        year. Dates are interpreted in the timezone of the location of the head office
        of the company.

      description: Fiscal year estimates for selected figures of a stock. Data is
        available only for common shares; instruments such as preferred shares or
        depository receipts yield an empty result. For the share type, see endpoint
        `/instrument/category/list` using dataset 23. Data can be retrieved only for
        the current, the past, and three future fiscal years. For past fiscal years,
        the estimates are not being replaced by the reported figures. Since a fiscal
        year and a calendar year do not necessarily match with regard to their start
        and end dates, the year is derived as the calendar year occupied to a larger
        extent by the fiscal year, using a June through May fiscal year assignment.
        That means, fiscal years ending from the 1st of June onwards are assigned
        to the same calendar year. Dates are interpreted in the timezone of the location

        Ranking of stocks' notations using intraday figures. The result is limited to 100 notations that all must satisfy all selected filters. If more than one notation of an instrument matches the parameters, and no market priority has been specified, only the notation with the highest trading volume, averaged over one month, is considered.

        By default, the result is sorted descending by the relative intraday performance corresponding to the most recent trade price, see attribute `trade.performance.relative`. The result may contain sortable values based on different currencies, possibly making the ranking nonsensical, if the parameter `currency` has not been specified.`

        The search can be restricted to a specific set of products by using customer-specific instrument or notation restriction lists. Such restriction lists are set up by FactSet upon request.

        Screener for stocks' notations based on stock-specific parameters. The result is limited to the notations that satisfy all the selected filters. If more than one notation of an instrument matches the parameters, and no market priority has been specified, only the notation with the highest trading volume, averaged over one month, is considered.

        Currency dependent current figures on company level (see attribute `currentKeyFigures.company.currencyDependent`) or on share instrument level (see attribute `currentKeyFigures.shareInstrument.currencyDependent`) are only returned if the currency (see parameter `currentKeyFigures.company.currencyDependent.currency.isoCode` or parameter `currentKeyFigures.shareInstrument.currencyDependent.currency.isoCode` respectively) are set.

        Parameters for up to three fiscal years might be used in one request, see attribute `reportedKeyFigures`; data is available for the ten most recent completed fiscal years. Estimates are available for the current and two consecutive fiscal years; parameters for all three might be used in one request, see attribute `estimates`. The estimated values are calculated as the average of the most recent estimates provided by all analysts in a fixed time frame of 100 days. Screening and sorting by a currency-dependent attribute is not possible if the currency (see parameter `reportedKeyFigures.currencyDependentKeyFigures.currency.isoCode` and parameter `estimates.currencyDependentEstimates.currency.isoCode` respectively) is not set. If a fiscal year for the data as of the end of a fiscal year (see parameter `reportedKeyFigures.fiscalYear`) or for the estimates (see parameter `estimates.fiscalYear`) has been selected but no currency has been set, the respective data will be returned in the currency in which it was originally reported.

        A specific set of stocks can be restricted to or excluded by using customer-specific instrument or notation selection lists. Such selection lists are set up by FactSet upon request. All identifiers used as parameters must be valid and entitled.

            The alternative notation is the one with the highest trading volume averaged
            over one month that satisfies all other selected filters, such as only
            a specific market or a specific currency. If the original notation is
            not entitled and a currency has not been specified, the alternative notation
            may be in a different currency than the original one which makes the ranking
            less meaningful, especially a trading value-based ranking, see attribute

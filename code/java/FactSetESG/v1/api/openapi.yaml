    FactSet ESG (powered by FactSet Truvalue Labs) applies machine learning to uncover risks and opportunities from companies' Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) behavior, which are aggregated and categorized into continuously updated, material ESG scores. The service focuses on company ESG behavior from external sources and includes both positive and negative events that go beyond traditional sources of ESG risk data.<p> FactSet ESG extracts, analyzes, and generates scores from millions of documents each month collected from more than 100,000 data sources in over 30 languages. Sources include news, trade journals, NGOs, watchdog groups, trade blogs, industry reports and social media. Products deliver investable insights by revealing value and risk factors from unstructured data at the speed of current events.</p>

          The FactSet Truvalue Score types being requested. Score Types include the Pulse, Insight, Momentum, Article Volume, Category Volume, Dynamic Materiality Score, Adjusted Insight, and Industry Percentile. When left blank all score types will be returned for the requested Id. To specify select scores returned in the response, provide a comma-separated list of the scores using the description below.
          <p>These scores use the same underlying data and 100-point scale, except for ranks and percentiles. The cognitive computing system behind FactSet's Truvalue Platform uses natural language processing to interpret semantic content and generate analytics. It does so by applying criteria that are consistent with established sustainability and ESG frameworks, scoring data points on performance using a 0 to 100 scale. A score of 50 represents a neutral impact. Scores above 50 indicate positive performance, and scores below reflect negative performance.</p>

          ### ESG Score Types

          |**SASB Category Input**|**Description**|
          |---|---|
          |**PULSE**|*Pulse Score*, is a measure of near-term performance changes that highlights opportunities and controversies, enabling real-time monitoring of companies. It focuses on events of the day and provides a responsive signal to alert investors to dynamic moves.|
          |**INSIGHT**|*Insight Score*, a measure of a company’s longer-term ESG track record, similar to a ratings system. Scores are less sensitive to daily events and reflect the enduring performance record of a company over time. Scores are derived using an exponentially-weighted moving average of the Pulse, defined below, and the half-life of an event’s influence on the overall score is 6 months.|
          |**MOMENTUM**|*Momentum Score*, measures the trend of a company's Insight score. It is a unique ESG metric in the industry that gives investors a high-precision view of the trajectory of a company’s ESG performance, relative to peers. It does so by precisely articulating upward or downward movement, relative to that of all others in the universe, making it a measure that enhances quantitative workflows.|
          |**ART_VOL_TTM**|*Article Volume Score*, measures the information flow or number of articles about a company over the past 12 months.|
          |**CAT_VOL_TTM**|*Category Volume Score*, returns the total number of times any of the 26 categories received a score over a trailing twelve-month (TTM) period of time.|
          |**DYNAMIC_MAT**|*Dynamic Materiality Score*, shows the percentage value of data flow by category compared with the total data flow for the organization **(NOT VALID for `ALLCATEGORIES` and `MATERIALITY` category types).**|
          |**ADJ_INSIGHT**|*Adjusted Insight*, Measures company ESG performance, generating scores for lower-volume and zero-volume firms by blending company scores with industry medians. **(ONLY Vaild for `ALLCATEGORIES` and `MATERIALITY` categories). <p>**Adjusted Insight Score = (# of articles / 5) x Company Insight Score + ((5 - # of articles) / 5) x Industry (or Sector) Median Insight Score.</p>|
          |**IND_PCTL**|*Industry Percentile*, offers context on company Adjusted Insight scores relative to peers in the same SICS Industry. This value is used to establish the textual ESG Rank. **(ONLY Vaild for `ALLCATEGORIES` and `MATERIALITY` categories).**|

          \ or collapse of systems upon which the economy and society depend. This\
          \ includes financial systems, natural resource systems, and technological\
          \ systems. It addresses the mechanisms a company has in place to reduce\
          \ its contributions to systemic risks and to improve safeguards that may\
          \ mitigate the impacts of systemic failure. For financial institutions,\
          \ the category also captures the company's ability to absorb shocks arising\
          \ from financial and economic stress and meet stricter regulatory requirements\
          \ related to the complexity and interconnectedness of companies in the industry.|\n\
          |**WASTEANDHZRDMATSMGT**|**Waste and Hazardous Materials Management** -\
          \ the category addresses environmental issues associated with hazardous\

          \ management of solid wastes in manufacturing, agriculture, and other industrial\
          \ processes. It covers treatment, handling, storage, disposal, and regulatory\
          \ compliance. The category does not cover emissions to air or wastewater,\

          \ which may be influenced by regional differences in the availability and\
          \ quality of and competition for water resources. More specifically, it\

          <p>These scores use the same underlying data and 100-point scale, except for ranks and percentiles. The cognitive computing system behind FactSet's Truvalue Platform uses natural language processing to interpret semantic content and generate analytics. It does so by applying criteria that are consistent with established sustainability and ESG frameworks, scoring data points on performance using a 0 to 100 scale. A score of 50 represents a neutral impact. Scores above 50 indicate positive performance, and scores below reflect negative performance.</p>

          ### ESG Score Types

          |**SASB Category Input**|**Description**|
          |---|---|
          |**PULSE**|*Pulse Score*, is a measure of near-term performance changes that highlights opportunities and controversies, enabling real-time monitoring of companies. It focuses on events of the day and provides a responsive signal to alert investors to dynamic moves.|
          |**INSIGHT**|*Insight Score*, a measure of a company’s longer-term ESG track record, similar to a ratings system. Scores are less sensitive to daily events and reflect the enduring performance record of a company over time. Scores are derived using an exponentially-weighted moving average of the Pulse, defined below, and the half-life of an event’s influence on the overall score is 6 months.|
          |**MOMENTUM**|*Momentum Score*, measures the trend of a company's Insight score. It is a unique ESG metric in the industry that gives investors a high-precision view of the trajectory of a company’s ESG performance, relative to peers. It does so by precisely articulating upward or downward movement, relative to that of all others in the universe, making it a measure that enhances quantitative workflows.|
          |**ART_VOL_TTM**|*Article Volume Score*, measures the information flow or number of articles about a company over the past 12 months.|
          |**CAT_VOL_TTM**|*Category Volume Score*, returns the total number of times any of the 26 categories received a score over a trailing twelve-month (TTM) period of time.|
          |**DYNAMIC_MAT**|*Dynamic Materiality Score*, shows the percentage value of data flow by category compared with the total data flow for the organization **(NOT VALID for `ALLCATEGORIES` and `MATERIALITY` category types).**|
          |**ADJ_INSIGHT**|*Adjusted Insight*, Measures company ESG performance, generating scores for lower-volume and zero-volume firms by blending company scores with industry medians. **(ONLY Vaild for `ALLCATEGORIES` and `MATERIALITY` categories). <p>**Adjusted Insight Score = (# of articles / 5) x Company Insight Score + ((5 - # of articles) / 5) x Industry (or Sector) Median Insight Score.</p>|
          |**IND_PCTL**|*Industry Percentile*, offers context on company Adjusted Insight scores relative to peers in the same SICS Industry. This value is used to establish the textual ESG Rank. **(ONLY Vaild for `ALLCATEGORIES` and `MATERIALITY` categories).**|

          ### Helper Input
          **ALL**= *Ability to fetch all of the "scoreTypes" listed above in a simplified query.* This is used by default and removes the need to explitly request each scoreType in the list.

            Amazon has asked federal regulators to block a number of shareholder proposals that strike to the heart of many recent criticisms of the Seattle-based commerce behemoth, including its stances on curbing hate speech and offensive content, diversity in hiring, workplace conditions for hourly warehouse employees and its surveillance technologies. According to letters filed Tuesday with the SEC, Amazon is now requesting the regulator block shareholder proposals asking the company to report on its efforts to check hate speech across its many platforms, consider qualified women and non-white candidates for open positions in all roles, add an hourly associate to its board of directors and assess whether its products with surveillance capabilities violate human rights. In the aftermath of the Jan. 6 uprising at the U.S. Capitol, media outlets reported that white-supremacist and far-right militants had found havens on Amazon's online marketplace and cloud-computing infrastructure. Conservative-dominated social network Parler, which Amazon booted from its cloud-computing service due to what it deemed was a proliferation of posts advocating violence, recently argued in court that even as one Amazon division was flagging abusive content for review, another was attempting to upsell Parler on enhanced cloud-computing technologies. Amazon has not issued objections to five other shareholder resolutions submitted in partnership with the religious group, including requests for reports on the company's facial recognition technology, efforts to reduce the use of plastic packaging and lobbying expenditures.

            Amazon's new Housing Equity Fund aims to create thousands of affordable housing units. E-commerce and technology behemoth Amazon announced its first round of funding toward its new Housing Equity Fund, featuring an investment of more than $567 million in a long-term plan to provide more affordable housing near its major offices. Announced on Wednesday, the company intends to build about 1,300 apartment homes near its new second headquarters in Arlington, Va., along with roughly 1,000 apartment units available near the original Puget Sound headquarters in Washington state. This commitment is the company's response to the jump in real estate prices accompanying its growth as Amazon brings talented workers to its locations with high-paying jobs. The fund will also expand inclusive housing through lower rates on home loans and partner with local nonprofits to preserve affordable housing options.

          primaryArticleBulletpoints: 'Beginning with the iPhone 12 series, Apple
            has lost its ability to match chargers in its boxes, triggering a lawsuit.
            A team of students from Beijing University of Chemical Technology and
            National Donghwa University took Apple to court after Apple was told that
            it was not giving away the adapter charger for its new product, according
            to media reports on October 25. The plaintiff said that most consumers
            and even Apple employees were equally divided and resentful of the serious
            violations of consumers'' legitimate rights and interests at Apple, but
            that most had become the silent majority. Some media raised objections
            to this: While Apple has canceled the supply of the charger for environmental
            reasons, the iPhone 12 charger is still in place, but not in the box,
            and Apple continues to manufacture. Furthermore, the iPhone 12 box is
            provided with a Lightning to USB-C charging line, which is not compatible
            with the 5W charging head provided in the past; In other words, unless
            you upgrade from iPhone 11 Pro, you will pay for a charger or Lightning
            to USB-A cable.'

            Apple is going to invest another $30 million to broaden its efforts even
            further. The new commitments will see Apple expand access to equity in
            education, elevate more app founders and technologists from underrepresented

            justice organizations. Apple today announced $30 million in new commitments
            as part of its Racial Equity and Justice Initiative (REJI), supporting
            students, innovators, and advocacy organizations that are leading the
            charge in creating a more inclusive, more just world. These new projects
            include a Global Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI) Equity Innovation
            Hub; expanded education initiatives for community colleges and Historically
            Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs); a new cohort of the Apple Entrepreneur

            people and managed by a decentralized network is particularly volatile,
            and its price is not always easy to determine. The volatility and anonymity
            it provides to its users is not welcomed by the authorities, who are calling
            for stricter regulation.

            Monday that the release was legitimate and the name change accurate. Volkswagen''s
            intentionally fake news release, highly unusual for a major public company,
            coincides with its efforts to repair its image as it tries to recover
            from a 2015 scandal in which it cheated on government emissions tests
            and allowed diesel-powered vehicles to illegally pollute the air. James
            Cox, who teaches corporate and securities law at Duke University, said
            the Securities and Exchange Commission should take action to deal with
            such misinformation, which can distort stock prices. Erik Gordon, a business
            and law professor at the University of Michigan, said he thought that
            for the SEC to be interested, it would have to believe that VW knowingly
            issued the fake news release to manipulate its stock price.'

          primaryArticleBulletpoints: Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said he hopes he is
            investigated by U.S. regulators over his online posts about the meme cryptocurrency
            dogecoin. The tech entrepreneur-who is currently the world's second richest
            person with a £176 billion net worth-has repeatedly referenced the token
            in recent weeks via his personal Twitter account, which has a vast reach
            of more than 48 million followers. Dogecoin was launched in 2013 using
            branding of a Shiba Inu dog from a then-popular internet meme, and has
            repeatedly been mentioned by Musk in the years since. Musk, who is well-documented
            as using internet memes, last tweeted about dogecoin on February 24, when
            he shared an image of the dog from its branding planting a flag on the
            moon, a play on a phrase used in the community to describe price surges.
            In September 2018, Musk settled a securities fraud charge brought by the
            agency in retaliation for a tweet sent on August 7, 2018 that said he
            could take Tesla private at $420 per share.

          primaryArticleBulletpoints: Whether the topic is transforming the automobile
            or conquering the next frontier of space, Elon Musk has shown a knack
            for captivating an audience beyond investors and science geeks. The norm-shattering
            entrepreneur, who has more than 41 million followers on Twitter and a
            fortune now estimated at more than $180 billion, announced last month
            he had relocated to Texas and could not resist one last dig at the West
            Coast state. Musk quickly dropped the go-private effort, but became embroiled
            in a bitter dispute with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC),
            which charged Musk with fraud, slapped him with a $20 million fine, and
            demanded he step down as Tesla chairman and agree to follow board-supervised
            protocols on his social media use. Around the same time, Musk also publicly
            sparred with a British caver, who had mocked the Tesla CEO's offer of
            a mini-submarine to rescue young soccer players trapped in a cave in Thailand
            in the summer of 2018. But Musk -- and Tesla -- hit his stride in 2020,
            with the company impressively lifting output in California and Shanghai,
            breaking ground on new factories, and scoring a series of profitable quarters
            as its market value soared.

          primaryArticleBulletpoints: LONDON (Reuters) -     Bitcoin soared above
            $50,000 on Tuesday to an all-time high, adding steam to a rally fuelled
            by signs that the world's biggest cryptocurrency is gaining acceptance
            among mainstream investors and companies. The move by Tesla, which also
            said it would accept bitcoin as payment, was the latest in a string of
            large investments that have vaulted bitcoin from the fringes of finance
            to company balance sheets and Wall Street, with U.S. firms and traditional
            money managers starting to buy the coin. Even as bitcoin laps into the
            mainstream, cryptocurrencies remain subject to patchy oversight around
            the world, with the lack of regulatory clarity and associations with crime
            keeping many larger investors leery of exposure. U.S. Treasury Secretary
            Janet Yellen and European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde both
            called last month for tighter oversight of bitcoin due to concerns over
            its use for criminal activities such as money laundering. U.S. business
            intelligence software firm MicroStrategy Inc, whose CEO has become one
            of bitcoin's most visible proponents, on Tuesday said it would issue $600
            million of debt through convertible notes to buy additional bitcoin.

          primaryArticleBulletpoints: According to the US Securities and Exchange
            Commission, Tesla was told last year that Elon Musk had twice violated
            the settlement when he used Twitter, under which his tweets were subject
            to review and approval by Tesla lawyers. Tesla shares soared on August
            7, 2018 after Mr. Musk said he would take the company private for $420
            a share and said he had received financial support. In a letter to Tesla,
            the SEC said that Mr. Musk was still violating the agreements in 2019
            and 2020 after the settlement, and that neither tweet had been approved.
            Another tweet, CNN said, was the May 1, 2020 tweet, which he complained
            about Tesla's stock price being too high, and which subsequently caused
            the company's share price to fall, losing more than $13bn in market value.
            CNN said the settlement showed that Mr. Musk needed approval to publish
            topics including Tesla's financial position, the relevant production figures
            or new lines of business.

        The FactSet Truvalue Score types being requested. Score Types include the Pulse, Insight, Momentum, Article Volume, Category Volume, Dynamic Materiality Score, Adjusted Insight, and Industry Percentile. When left blank all score types will be returned for the requested Id. To specify select scores returned in the response, provide a comma-separated list of the scores using the description below.
        <p>These scores use the same underlying data and 100-point scale, except for ranks and percentiles. The cognitive computing system behind FactSet's Truvalue Platform uses natural language processing to interpret semantic content and generate analytics. It does so by applying criteria that are consistent with established sustainability and ESG frameworks, scoring data points on performance using a 0 to 100 scale. A score of 50 represents a neutral impact. Scores above 50 indicate positive performance, and scores below reflect negative performance.</p>

        ### ESG Score Types

        |**SASB Category Input**|**Description**|
        |---|---|
        |**PULSE**|*Pulse Score*, is a measure of near-term performance changes that highlights opportunities and controversies, enabling real-time monitoring of companies. It focuses on events of the day and provides a responsive signal to alert investors to dynamic moves.|
        |**INSIGHT**|*Insight Score*, a measure of a company’s longer-term ESG track record, similar to a ratings system. Scores are less sensitive to daily events and reflect the enduring performance record of a company over time. Scores are derived using an exponentially-weighted moving average of the Pulse, defined below, and the half-life of an event’s influence on the overall score is 6 months.|
        |**MOMENTUM**|*Momentum Score*, measures the trend of a company's Insight score. It is a unique ESG metric in the industry that gives investors a high-precision view of the trajectory of a company’s ESG performance, relative to peers. It does so by precisely articulating upward or downward movement, relative to that of all others in the universe, making it a measure that enhances quantitative workflows.|
        |**ART_VOL_TTM**|*Article Volume Score*, measures the information flow or number of articles about a company over the past 12 months.|
        |**CAT_VOL_TTM**|*Category Volume Score*, returns the total number of times any of the 26 categories received a score over a trailing twelve-month (TTM) period of time.|
        |**DYNAMIC_MAT**|*Dynamic Materiality Score*, shows the percentage value of data flow by category compared with the total data flow for the organization **(NOT VALID for `ALLCATEGORIES` and `MATERIALITY` category types).**|
        |**ADJ_INSIGHT**|*Adjusted Insight*, Measures company ESG performance, generating scores for lower-volume and zero-volume firms by blending company scores with industry medians. **(ONLY Vaild for `ALLCATEGORIES` and `MATERIALITY` categories). <p>**Adjusted Insight Score = (# of articles / 5) x Company Insight Score + ((5 - # of articles) / 5) x Industry (or Sector) Median Insight Score.</p>|
        |**IND_PCTL**|*Industry Percentile*, offers context on company Adjusted Insight scores relative to peers in the same SICS Industry. This value is used to establish the textual ESG Rank. **(ONLY Vaild for `ALLCATEGORIES` and `MATERIALITY` categories).**|

A score of 50 represents a neutral impact. Scores above 50 indicate positive performance, and scores below reflect negative performance.</p>

            ### ESG Score Types

            |**SASB Category Input**|**Description**|
            |---|---|
            |**PULSE**|*Pulse Score*, is a measure of near-term performance changes that highlights opportunities and controversies, enabling real-time monitoring of companies. It focuses on events of the day and provides a responsive signal to alert investors to dynamic moves.|
            |**INSIGHT**|*Insight Score*, a measure of a company's longer-term ESG track record, similar to a ratings system. Scores are less sensitive to daily events and reflect the enduring performance record of a company over time. Scores are derived using an exponentially-weighted moving average of the Pulse, defined below, and the half-life of an event's influence on the overall score is 6 months.|
            |**MOMENTUM**|*Momentum Score*, measures the trend of a company's Insight score. It is a unique ESG metric in the industry that gives investors a high-precision view of the trajectory of a company's ESG performance, relative to peers. It does so by precisely articulating upward or downward movement, relative to that of all others in the universe, making it a measure that enhances quantitative workflows.|
            |**ART_VOL_TTM**|*Article Volume Score*, measures the information flow or number of articles about a company over the past 12 months.|
            |**CAT_VOL_TTM**|*Category Volume Score*, returns the total number of times any of the 26 categories received a score over a trailing twelve-month (TTM) period of time.|
            |**DYNAMIC_MAT**|*Dynamic Materiality Score*, shows the percentage value of data flow by category compared with the total data flow for the organization **(NOT VALID for `ALLCATEGORIES` and `MATERIALITY` category types).**|
            |**ADJ_INSIGHT**|*Adjusted Insight*, Measures company ESG performance, generating scores for lower-volume and zero-volume firms by blending company scores with industry medians. **(ONLY Vaild for `ALLCATEGORIES` and `MATERIALITY` categories). <p>**Adjusted Insight Score = (# of articles / 5) x Company Insight Score + ((5 - # of articles) / 5) x Industry (or Sector) Median Insight Score.</p>|
            |**IND_PCTL**|*Industry Percentile*, offers context on company Adjusted Insight scores relative to peers in the same SICS Industry. This value is used to establish the textual ESG Rank. **(ONLY Vaild for `ALLCATEGORIES` and `MATERIALITY` categories).**|

            \ activity of suppliers, which can further affect availability and pricing\
            \ of key resources. It addresses a company's ability to manage these risks\
            \ through product design, manufacturing, and end-of-life management, such\
            \ as by using of recycled and renewable materials, reducing the use of\
            \ key materials (dematerialization), maximizing resource efficiency in\
            \ manufacturing, and making R&D investments in substitute materials. Additionally,\
            \ companies can manage these issues by screening, selection, monitoring,\
            \ and engagement with suppliers to ensure their resilience to external\
            \ risks. It does not address issues associated with environmental and\
            \ social externalities created by operational activity of individual suppliers,\

            \ climate change consideration in products and services sold, such as\
            \ insurance policies and mortgages. The category relates to the company's\
            \ ability to adapt to increased frequency and severity of extreme weather,\
            \ shifting climate, sea level risk, and other expected physical impacts\
            \ of climate change. Management may involve enhancing resiliency of physical\
            \ assets and/or surrounding infrastructure as well as incorporation of\
            \ climate change-related considerations into key business activities (e.g.,\
            \ mortgage and insurance underwriting, planning and development of real\

            \ such as those related to packaging, distribution, use-phase resource\
            \ intensity, and other environmental and social externalities that may\
            \ occur during their use-phase or at the end of life. The category captures\
            \ a company's ability to address customer and societal demand for more\
            \ sustainable products and services as well as to meet evolving environmental\
            \ and social regulation. It does not address direct environmental or social\
            \ impacts of the company's operations nor does it address health and safety\
            \ risks to consumers from product use, which are covered in other categories.|\n\
            |**PRODQUALITYANDSFTY**|**Product Quality and Safety** - the category\

            The FactSet Truvalue Score types being requested. Score Types include the Pulse, Insight, Momentum, Article Volume, Category Volume, Dynamic Materiality Score, Adjusted Insight, and Industry Percentile. When left blank all score types will be returned for the requested Id. To specify select scores returned in the response, provide a comma-separated list of the scores using the description below.
            <p>These scores use the same underlying data and 100-point scale, except for ranks and percentiles. The cognitive computing system behind FactSet's Truvalue Platform uses natural language processing to interpret semantic content and generate analytics. It does so by applying criteria that are consistent with established sustainability and ESG frameworks, scoring data points on performance using a 0 to 100 scale. A score of 50 represents a neutral impact. Scores above 50 indicate positive performance, and scores below reflect negative performance.</p>

            ### ESG Score Types

            |**SASB Category Input**|**Description**|
            |---|---|
            |**PULSE**|*Pulse Score*, is a measure of near-term performance changes that highlights opportunities and controversies, enabling real-time monitoring of companies. It focuses on events of the day and provides a responsive signal to alert investors to dynamic moves.|
            |**INSIGHT**|*Insight Score*, a measure of a company's longer-term ESG track record, similar to a ratings system. Scores are less sensitive to daily events and reflect the enduring performance record of a company over time. Scores are derived using an exponentially-weighted moving average of the Pulse, defined below, and the half-life of an event's influence on the overall score is 6 months.|
            |**MOMENTUM**|*Momentum Score*, measures the trend of a company's Insight score. It is a unique ESG metric in the industry that gives investors a high-precision view of the trajectory of a company's ESG performance, relative to peers. It does so by precisely articulating upward or downward movement, relative to that of all others in the universe, making it a measure that enhances quantitative workflows.|
            |**ART_VOL_TTM**|*Article Volume Score*, measures the information flow or number of articles about a company over the past 12 months.|
            |**CAT_VOL_TTM**|*Category Volume Score*, returns the total number of times any of the 26 categories received a score over a trailing twelve-month (TTM) period of time.|
            |**DYNAMIC_MAT**|*Dynamic Materiality Score*, shows the percentage value of data flow by category compared with the total data flow for the organization **(NOT VALID for `ALLCATEGORIES` and `MATERIALITY` category types).**|
            |**ADJ_INSIGHT**|*Adjusted Insight*, Measures company ESG performance, generating scores for lower-volume and zero-volume firms by blending company scores with industry medians. **(ONLY Vaild for `ALLCATEGORIES` and `MATERIALITY` categories). <p>**Adjusted Insight Score = (# of articles / 5) x Company Insight Score + ((5 - # of articles) / 5) x Industry (or Sector) Median Insight Score.</p>|
            |**IND_PCTL**|*Industry Percentile*, offers context on company Adjusted Insight scores relative to peers in the same SICS Industry. This value is used to establish the textual ESG Rank. **(ONLY Vaild for `ALLCATEGORIES` and `MATERIALITY` categories).**|

            ### Helper Input
            **ALL**= *Ability to fetch all of the "scoreTypes" listed above in a simplified query.* This is used by default and removes the need to explitly request each scoreType in the list.

Score Types include the Pulse, Insight, Momentum, Article Volume, Category Volume, Dynamic Materiality Score, Adjusted Insight, and Industry Percentile. When left blank all score types will be returned for the requested Id. To specify select scores returned in the response, provide a comma-separated list of the scores using the description below.
        <p>These scores use the same underlying data and 100-point scale, except for ranks and percentiles. The cognitive computing system behind FactSet's Truvalue Platform uses natural language processing to interpret semantic content and generate analytics. It does so by applying criteria that are consistent with established sustainability and ESG frameworks, scoring data points on performance using a 0 to 100 scale. A score of 50 represents a neutral impact. Scores above 50 indicate positive performance, and scores below reflect negative performance.</p>

        ### ESG Score Types

        |**SASB Category Input**|**Description**|
        |---|---|
        |**PULSE**|*Pulse Score*, is a measure of near-term performance changes that highlights opportunities and controversies, enabling real-time monitoring of companies. It focuses on events of the day and provides a responsive signal to alert investors to dynamic moves.|
        |**INSIGHT**|*Insight Score*, a measure of a company's longer-term ESG track record, similar to a ratings system. Scores are less sensitive to daily events and reflect the enduring performance record of a company over time. Scores are derived using an exponentially-weighted moving average of the Pulse, defined below, and the half-life of an event's influence on the overall score is 6 months.|
        |**MOMENTUM**|*Momentum Score*, measures the trend of a company's Insight score. It is a unique ESG metric in the industry that gives investors a high-precision view of the trajectory of a company's ESG performance, relative to peers. It does so by precisely articulating upward or downward movement, relative to that of all others in the universe, making it a measure that enhances quantitative workflows.|
        |**ART_VOL_TTM**|*Article Volume Score*, measures the information flow or number of articles about a company over the past 12 months.|
        |**CAT_VOL_TTM**|*Category Volume Score*, returns the total number of times any of the 26 categories received a score over a trailing twelve-month (TTM) period of time.|
        |**DYNAMIC_MAT**|*Dynamic Materiality Score*, shows the percentage value of data flow by category compared with the total data flow for the organization **(NOT VALID for `ALLCATEGORIES` and `MATERIALITY` category types).**|
        |**ADJ_INSIGHT**|*Adjusted Insight*, Measures company ESG performance, generating scores for lower-volume and zero-volume firms by blending company scores with industry medians. **(ONLY Vaild for `ALLCATEGORIES` and `MATERIALITY` categories). <p>**Adjusted Insight Score = (# of articles / 5) x Company Insight Score + ((5 - # of articles) / 5) x Industry (or Sector) Median Insight Score.</p>|
        |**IND_PCTL**|*Industry Percentile*, offers context on company Adjusted Insight scores relative to peers in the same SICS Industry. This value is used to establish the textual ESG Rank. **(ONLY Vaild for `ALLCATEGORIES` and `MATERIALITY` categories).**|

        ### Helper Input
        **ALL**= *Ability to fetch all of the "scoreTypes" listed above in a simplified query.* This is used by default and removes the need to explitly request each scoreType in the list.

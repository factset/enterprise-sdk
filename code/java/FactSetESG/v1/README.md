FactSet ESG (powered by FactSet Truvalue Labs) applies machine learning to uncover risks and opportunities from companies' Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) behavior, which are aggregated and categorized into continuously updated, material ESG scores. The service focuses on company ESG behavior from external sources and includes both positive and negative events that go beyond traditional sources of ESG risk data.<p> FactSet ESG extracts, analyzes, and generates scores from millions of documents each month collected from more than 100,000 data sources in over 30 languages. Sources include news, trade journals, NGOs, watchdog groups, trade blogs, industry reports and social media. Products deliver investable insights by revealing value and risk factors from unstructured data at the speed of current events.</p>

        try {
            SasbArticlesResponse result = apiInstance.getSasbArticles(ids, startDate, endDate, dateOf, fields, categories);
            System.out.println(result);
        } catch (ApiException e) {
            System.err.println("Exception when calling ArticlesApi#getSasbArticles");
            System.err.println("Status code: " + e.getCode());
            System.err.println("Reason: " + e.getResponseBody());
            System.err.println("Response headers: " + e.getResponseHeaders());
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

```

### Using a Proxy

To add a HTTP proxy for the API client, use `ClientConfig`:
```java

import org.glassfish.jersey.apache.connector.ApacheConnectorProvider;
import org.glassfish.jersey.client.ClientConfig;
import org.glassfish.jersey.client.ClientProperties;
import com.factset.sdk.FactSetESG.*;
import com.factset.sdk.FactSetESG.api.ArticlesApi;

...

ApiClient defaultClient = Configuration.getDefaultApiClient();
ClientConfig clientConfig = defaultClient.getClientConfig();
clientConfig.connectorProvider(new ApacheConnectorProvider());
clientConfig.property(ClientProperties.PROXY_URI, "http://proxy_url_here");
clientConfig.property(ClientProperties.PROXY_USERNAME, "proxy_username");
clientConfig.property(ClientProperties.PROXY_PASSWORD, "proxy_password");
defaultClient.setClientConfig(clientConfig);

ArticlesApi apiInstance = new ArticlesApi(defaultClient);

```

### Debugging
The SDK uses the standard library class [`java.util.logging.Logger`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/logging/Logger.html).

Calling `setDebugging(true)` on an instance of the `ApiClient` will return an instance of the `ApiClient` that has set the logger's [`Level`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/logging/Level.html) to `ALL`.

**Note**: This prints out sensitive information (e.g. the full request and response). Use with care.

```java
import com.factset.sdk.FactSetESG.ApiClient;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        ApiClient defaultClient = new ApiClient();
        defaultClient.setDebugging(true);

        // Setup authentication and make request with apiInstance...
    }
}
```

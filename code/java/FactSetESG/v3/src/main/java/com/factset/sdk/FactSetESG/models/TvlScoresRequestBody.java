/*
 * FactSet ESG API
 * FactSet ESG (powered by FactSet Truvalue) applies Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning to uncover risks and opportunities from companies' Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) behavior, which are aggregated and categorized into continuously updated, material ESG scores. The service focuses on company ESG behavior from external sources and includes both positive and negative events that go beyond traditional sources of ESG risk data.<p> FactSet ESG extracts, analyzes, and generates scores from millions of documents each month collected from more than 200,000 data sources in over 38 languages. Sources include news, trade journals, NGOs, watchdog groups, trade blogs and industry reports. Products deliver investable insights by revealing value and risk factors from unstructured data at the speed of current events.</p>

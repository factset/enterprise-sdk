    FactSet ESG (powered by FactSet Truvalue) applies Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning to uncover risks and opportunities from companies' Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) behavior, which are aggregated and categorized into continuously updated, material ESG scores. The service focuses on company ESG behavior from external sources and includes both positive and negative events that go beyond traditional sources of ESG risk data.<p> FactSet ESG extracts, analyzes, and generates scores from millions of documents each month collected from more than 200,000 data sources in over 38 languages. Sources include news, trade journals, NGOs, watchdog groups, trade blogs and industry reports. Products deliver investable insights by revealing value and risk factors from unstructured data at the speed of current events.</p>

          |---|---|\n|**TOPLEVEL**| This category represents a comprehensive overview\
          \ of a company's Truvalue Score by integrating two key perspectives: ALLCATEGORIES\
          \ and MATERIALITY.|\n||**ALLCATEGORIES**  represents a company's overall\
          \ Truvalue Score for the specific 'scoreType'. This value is equal to the\
          \ cumulative average of all 26 SASB categories for the specific 'scoreType'.\
          \ **Note** that category is not available for the Dynamic Materiality 'scoreType'.\n\
          ||**MATERIALITY**  represents a composite score of all 'material' SASB categories\
          \ for the given entity.|\n|**PILLARS**| Pillars are high-level categorizations\
          \ of **Environmental, Social, and Governance** factors used to organize\
          \ and group the 26 SASB categories. The three main pillars are Environmental,\
          \ Social, and Governance. Each pillar encompasses several SASB categories\
          \ that are thematically related. Pillars provide a broad framework for understanding\
          \ and assessing a company's SASB performance and risks across these three\
          \ fundamental areas.|\n|**DIMENSIONS**|Dimensions offer a more nuanced classification\
          \ system for the 26 SASB categories, breaking them down into five distinct\
          \ areas: **Environment, Business Model and Innovation, Human Capital, Leadership\
          \ and Governance, and Social Capital**. This framework provides a more detailed\
          \ and comprehensive view of a company's sustainability related activities,\
          \ allowing for a more granular analysis of performance and risk across these\
          \ five key dimensions of business operations and impact.|\n|**SASBCATEGORIES**|\
          \ The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) has developed a comprehensive\
          \ set of 26 sustainability-related business topics, often referred to as\
          \ general sustainability issues. These categories are integral to SASB's\
          \ Materiality Map, which identifies the Environmental, Social, and Governance\
          \ (ESG) issues most likely to be material for companies across different\
          \ industries. The categories span crucial areas such as Greenhouse Gas Emissions,\
          \ Air Quality, Energy Management, Water and Waste Management, Ecological\
          \ Impacts, Human Rights, Labor Practices, Product Safety, Data Security,\
          \ Business Ethics, and Systemic Risk Management, among others. Each category\
          \ is crafted to capture specific sustainability risks and opportunities\
          \ that may impact a company's financial condition, operating performance,\
          \ or risk profile. By providing a standardized framework and leveraging\
          \ the Materiality Map, SASB facilitates more effective communication between\
          \ companies and investors regarding the sustainability matters most pertinent\
          \ to financial performance. |\n"

        SFDR Principle Adverse Impact (PAI) data is built specifically to support compliant Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) reporting. FactSet collects PAI data items from publicly available company-reported information and FactSet databases, such as FactSet Fundamentals, FactSet RBICS with Revenue and FactSet People, which are also based on company-disclosures. FactSet uses Truvalue Labs SASB Spotlights for supplemental OECD & UNGC violation checks where company reporting is sparse.

        \ group the 26 SASB categories. The three main pillars are Environmental,\
        \ Social, and Governance. Each pillar encompasses several SASB categories\

        \ fundamental areas.|\n|**DIMENSIONS**|Dimensions offer a more nuanced classification\

        \ The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) has developed a comprehensive\
        \ set of 26 sustainability-related business topics, often referred to as general\

        \ Map, which identifies the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) issues\
        \ most likely to be material for companies across different industries. The\
        \ categories span crucial areas such as Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Air Quality,\
        \ Energy Management, Water and Waste Management, Ecological Impacts, Human\
        \ Rights, Labor Practices, Product Safety, Data Security, Business Ethics,\
        \ and Systemic Risk Management, among others. Each category is crafted to\
        \ capture specific sustainability risks and opportunities that may impact\
        \ a company's financial condition, operating performance, or risk profile.\
        \ By providing a standardized framework and leveraging the Materiality Map,\

            \ two key perspectives: ALLCATEGORIES and MATERIALITY.|\n||**ALLCATEGORIES**\
            \  represents a company's overall Truvalue Score for the specific 'scoreType'.\
            \ This value is equal to the cumulative average of all 26 SASB categories\
            \ for the specific 'scoreType'. **Note** that category is not available\

            \ a composite score of all 'material' SASB categories for the given entity.|\n\
            |**PILLARS**| Pillars are high-level categorizations of **Environmental,\
            \ Social, and Governance** factors used to organize and group the 26 SASB\
            \ categories. The three main pillars are Environmental, Social, and Governance.\
            \ Each pillar encompasses several SASB categories that are thematically\
            \ related. Pillars provide a broad framework for understanding and assessing\
            \ a company's SASB performance and risks across these three fundamental\
            \ areas.|\n|**DIMENSIONS**|Dimensions offer a more nuanced classification\
            \ system for the 26 SASB categories, breaking them down into five distinct\
            \ areas: **Environment, Business Model and Innovation, Human Capital,\
            \ Leadership and Governance, and Social Capital**. This framework provides\
            \ a more detailed and comprehensive view of a company's sustainability\
            \ related activities, allowing for a more granular analysis of performance\
            \ and risk across these five key dimensions of business operations and\
            \ impact.|\n|**SASBCATEGORIES**| The Sustainability Accounting Standards\
            \ Board (SASB) has developed a comprehensive set of 26 sustainability-related\
            \ business topics, often referred to as general sustainability issues.\
            \ These categories are integral to SASB's Materiality Map, which identifies\
            \ the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) issues most likely to\
            \ be material for companies across different industries. The categories\
            \ span crucial areas such as Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Air Quality, Energy\
            \ Management, Water and Waste Management, Ecological Impacts, Human Rights,\
            \ Labor Practices, Product Safety, Data Security, Business Ethics, and\
            \ Systemic Risk Management, among others. Each category is crafted to\
            \ capture specific sustainability risks and opportunities that may impact\
            \ a company's financial condition, operating performance, or risk profile.\
            \ By providing a standardized framework and leveraging the Materiality\
            \ Map, SASB facilitates more effective communication between companies\
            \ and investors regarding the sustainability matters most pertinent to\
            \ financial performance. |\n"

        \ Map, which identifies the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) issues\
        \ most likely to be material for companies across different industries. The\
        \ categories span crucial areas such as Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Air Quality,\
        \ Energy Management, Water and Waste Management, Ecological Impacts, Human\
        \ Rights, Labor Practices, Product Safety, Data Security, Business Ethics,\
        \ and Systemic Risk Management, among others. Each category is crafted to\
        \ capture specific sustainability risks and opportunities that may impact\
        \ a company's financial condition, operating performance, or risk profile.\
        \ By providing a standardized framework and leveraging the Materiality Map,\

        \ regarding the sustainability matters most pertinent to financial performance.\

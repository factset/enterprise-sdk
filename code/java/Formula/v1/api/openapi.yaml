    **FactSet Formula API**

    FactSet’s Formula API is a modern, flexible, formula-based API that enables users to access FactSet’s wide range of financial data and content. The API offers two endpoints, one optimized for time-series analysis and one designed for cross-sectional analysis, providing users a simplified interface into FactSet’s expansive offering. By providing two endpoints, it allows for the optimization of user workflows, while reducing complexity.

    Leverage the power and flexibility of the Formula API to -
      * Pull data from across most content sets that a user has access to in a single request
      * Include business logic and mathematical operations in request
      * Submit a dynamic universe in both endpoints
      * Return the fsymId to easily combine with other FactSet content / products
      * Set the trading calendar
      * Define custom display names

    **Formula API Request Builder**

    The Formula API Request Builder provides users everything they need to form a Formula API request. In the Request Builder, you can select identifiers, build a universe expression, select FQL or Screening formulas, easily apply business logic and mathematical functions to the FQL or Screening formulas, specify optional parameters, and construct a GET or POST request. The Request Builder eliminates the need to have previous FQL and Screening knowledge and allows you to quickly find your desired data items and form the request.

    The Formula API Request Builder can be accessed by navigating to [https://developer.factset.com/formula-api-request-builder](https://developer.factset.com/formula-api-request-builder) and logging in using your FactSet.net ID. When using the Request Builder to construct requests for the one of the Formula API's endpoints, be sure to toggle to the correct endpoint at the top of the page.

    **How to Check the Health and Availability of the Formula API**

    Please use the below endpoint to check the health and availability of the Formula API. You must be authorized for this API to use the Health endpoint.

    **How to Programmatically Download API Specification File**

    Please use the below endpoint to download the FactSet Formula API Specification File in .yaml. You must be authorized for this API to extract. This specification can then be used for Codegen to create your own SDKs. You can also download the spec using the "Download Spec" button to the right of the version number.

        The `/time-series` endpoint is closely aligned with FactSet’s powerful data retrieval language **FactSet Query Language (FQL)** which is optimized for time-series analysis. FQL can also perform sophisticated statistical, mathematical, logical, and other complex operations on the data.

          This endpoint has a unique **TIMESERIES** data object that pairs the requested data with FactSet provided dates. This helps reduce the need for additional data requests and reduces the work required by users.

        The `/time-series` endpoint supports Long Running asynchronous requests up to **10 minutes** via the `batch` parameter. *This feature is available to Individual Users subscribed to the Performance Package and Performance Package Plus Performance Tiers and all Production Users. If you are unsure which Performance Tier you are subscribed to or you would like to gain access to the batch capabilities, please contact your FactSet Account Team or "Report Issue" above and our support teams can assist.*

              These data items showcase the ability to include logic, mathematical operations, and other functions in the request itself.

              The first data item using the division operator to calculate a P/E ratio from the last trading day of the company’s most recent fiscal year.

              The second data item uses the addition operator to calculate percentage of revenue exposure in the US and Japan for the same date as the first data item. Note that due to URI defintion of the plus sign, the **+** symbol must be URL percent encoded as **%2B** in GET requests. This means you should use **%2B** in place of the symbol **+** in the request.

              The third data item uses the average function (**AVG**) and the **IF** function to indicate whether the average daily price change over the company’s most recent fiscal year is postive or negative.

        The `/time-series` endpoint is closely aligned with FactSet’s powerful data retrieval language **FactSet Query Language (FQL)** which is optimized for time-series analysis. FQL can also perform sophisticated statistical, mathematical, logical, and other complex operations on the data.

          This endpoint has a unique **TIMESERIES** data object that pairs the requested data with FactSet provided dates. This helps reduce the need for additional data requests and reduces the work required by users.

        The `/time-series` endpoint supports Long Running asynchronous requests up to **10 minutes** via the `batch` parameter. *This feature is available to Individual Users subscribed to the Performance Package and Performance Package Plus Performance Tiers and all Production Users. If you are unsure which Performance Tier you are subscribed to or you would like to gain access to the batch capabilities, please contact your FactSet Account Team or "Report Issue" above and our support teams can assist.*

              These data items showcase the ability to include logic, mathematical operations, and other functions in the request itself.

              The first data item using the division operator to calculate a P/E ratio from the last trading day of the company’s most recent fiscal year.

              The second data item uses the addition operator to calculate percentage of revenue exposure in the US and Japan for the same date as the first data item. Note that due to URI defintion of the plus sign, the **+** symbol must be URL percent encoded as **%2B** in GET requests. This means you should use **%2B** in place of the symbol **+** in the request.

              The third data item uses the **IF** function and greater than operator (**>**) to indicate whether the latest fiscal year's sales were higher or lower than the previous year's sales.

          item **fsymId** which will contain the fsymIds of the requestIds. This is in addition to the

          is **N**.

          The **fsymId** field returned is the FactSet Default Permanent Identifier for the `requestId`. For all supported `requestId` symbol types, the `fsymId` parameter will return the Regional Level PermId '-R' which identifies the security’s best regional security data series per currency. Currently, the fsymId parameter only supports equities. Accepted `requestId` symbol types include all FactSet Permanent Identifiers types, CUSIP, SEDOL, ISIN, and Tickers.

          If the number of display names does not match the number of formulas provided, an error will be returned.

          To define the display name for a subset of the formulas, leave a blank in the position of the formula that won't be renamed. For example - If three formulas are inputted, to define display names only for the first and third formula, enter *displayName=FORMULA_1,,FORMULA_3*. The **displayName** field will still be included in that formula, but will contain the formula as inputted.

        The `/cross-sectional` endpoint is closely aligned with FactSet’s powerful data retrieval **Screening language** which is optimized for analysis of data items at single point in time for different entities and is extremely efficient for large universes.

        The `/cross-sectional` endpoint supports Long Running asynchronous requests up to **10 minutes** via the `batch` parameter. *This feature is available to Individual Users subscribed to the Performance Package and Performance Package Plus Performance Tiers and all Production Users. If you are unsure which Performance Tier you are subscribed to or you would like to gain access to the batch capabilities, please contact your FactSet Account Team or "Report Issue" above and our support teams can assist.*

            The second data item uses the addition operator to calculate percentage of revenue exposure in the US and Japan for the same date as the first data item. Note that due to URI defintion of the plus sign, the **+** symbol must be URL percent encoded as **%2B** in GET requests. This means you should use **%2B** in place of the symbol **+** in the request.

        Data model returned when the parameter **flatten=Y** is used in the request. This flattened, simplified JSON output returned from **flatten=Y** can be conceptualized as a table (rows and columns) where each data object in the result is a row in the table and each field names is a column name. The response will contain at least one data object for each requestId containing the requestId, fsymId (if requested), date (if applicable) and Key-Value pairs for each data item (formula). The number of data objects (rows) per requestId is dependent the the objectTypes of the formulas requested.

        ---
        Formulas that have associated dates (TIMESERIES objectType in the standard **flatten=N** response model) will result in a data object for each date for each requestId.

        Formulas that result in an array (no associated dates, ARRAY objectType in the standard **flatten=N** response model) can be thought of as a column in a table. Each element in the array will be in a separate data object. The first element of the array starts in the first data object for that requestId and then then the second element of the array in the second data object for that requestId and so on (regardless of dates from other formulas).

        **flatten=N ARRAY Representation**
        ```json
        [
          {
            "requestId": "id",
            "formula": "formulaName",
            "result": [a,b,c],
            "objectType": "ARRAY",
            "dataType": "DOUBLE"
          }
        ]
        ```

        **flatten=Y ARRAY Representation**
        ```json
        [
          {
            "requestId": "id",
            "formulaName": a,
          },
          {
            "requestId": "id",
            "formulaName": b,
          },
          {
            "requestId": "id",
            "formulaName": c,
          }
        ]
        ```
        ---
        Scalar data items (SCALAR objectType in the standard **flatten=N** response model) will be repeated in each data object for the requestId.

        **flatten=N SCALAR Representation**
        ```json
        [
          {
            "requestId": "id",
            "formula": "formulaName",
            "result": a,
            "objectType": "ARRAY",
            "dataType": "DOUBLE"
          }
        ]
        ```

        **flatten=Y SCALAR Representation**
        ```json
        [
          {
            "requestId": "id",

        ]
        ```

        Formulas that result in a matrix (2 dimensional array, MATRIX objectType in the standard **flatten=N** response model) can be thought of as returning a table where each array in the array of arrays is a row in the table. This can be extended to the flattened result structure where each data object is a row in a table.  The formula will have as many attributes (appended by [n]) as number of columns in the matrix result.

        **flatten=N MATRIX Representation**
        ```json
        [
          {

            "dataType": "DOUBLE"
          }

            Enables the ability to asynchronously "batch" the request, supporting a long-running request up to **10 minutes**. Upon requesting "batch": "Y", the service will respond back with an HTTP Status Code of 202.

            A user is limited to running 5 Batch Requests in a 10 minute period.

            *This feature is available to Individual Users subscribed to the Performance Package and Performance Package Plus Performance Tiers and all Production Users. If you are unsure which Performance Tier you are subscribed to or you would like to gain access to the batch capabilities, please contact your FactSet Account Team or "Report Issue" above and our support teams can assist.*

            Once a batch request is submitted, use `/batch-status` to see if the job has completed. Once completed, retrieve the results of the request via `/batch-result`. See the endpoints listed under *Batch Processing* for more information.

            Specify **Y** for `fsymId` to return an additional response object for the data item fsymId which will contain the fsymIds of the requestIds, in addition to the response object containing the data item requestId. The default value for `fsymId` is **N**.

            The **fsymId** field returned is the FactSet Default Permanent Identifier for the `requestId`. For all supported `requestId` symbol types, the `fsymId` parameter will return the Regional Level PermId '-R' which identifies the security’s best regional security data series per currency. Currently, the fsymId parameter only supports equities. Accepted `requestId` symbol types include all FactSet Permanent Identifiers types, CUSIP, SEDOL, ISIN, and Tickers.

            Define display names for the formulas inputted. Enter the list of display names in the same order as the formulas inputted. An additional field **displayName** will be returned in the data object for a formula.

            If the number of display names does not match the number of formulas provided, an error will be returned.

            To define the display name for a subset of the formulas, leave a blank in the position of the formula that won't be renamed. For example - If three formulas are inputted, to define display names only for the first and third formula, enter *displayName=FORMULA_1,,FORMULA_3*. The **displayName** field will still be included in that formula, but will contain the formula as inputted.

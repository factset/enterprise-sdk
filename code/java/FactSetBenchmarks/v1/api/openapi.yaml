        Retrieves the index level ratios for a requested benchmark. Ratios supported are expressed through metrics parameter, and include Categories of Profitability, Valuation, Coverage, and Leverage. <p> Using FactSet Market Aggregates, the service combines FactSet Fundamental, FactSet Estimates, and FactSet Pricing content to derive ratios and per share values for global equity market indexes and commercial benchmark vendors. The constituents of the index are fetched on rolling basis over time period requested, and then the metric requested is aggregated up to the index level.

        Gets security prices', Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, VWAP, Trade Count, and Turn Over for a specified list of securities, date range, currency, and adjustment factors.
      operationId: getGPDPrices
      parameters:
      - description: The requested list of security identifiers. Accepted ID types
          include Market Tickers, SEDOL, ISINs, CUSIPs, or FactSet Permanent IDs.
          **IDs limit** = 500 per non-batch request / 2000 per batch request for a
          single day and 50 per multi-day request for both batch and non-batch. The
          number of unique currencies present in the requested IDs is limited to 50
          per request. Make note, GET Method URL request lines are also limited to
          a total length of 8192 bytes (8KB). In cases where the service allows for
          thousands of IDs, which may lead to exceeding this request line limit of
          8KB, it's advised for any requests with large request lines to be requested
          through the respective "POST" method.

Use the batch status endpoint to check job progress, and retrieve results using the batch-result endpoint once processing is complete.
        Request Limits:
          - Non-batch (real-time) requests:

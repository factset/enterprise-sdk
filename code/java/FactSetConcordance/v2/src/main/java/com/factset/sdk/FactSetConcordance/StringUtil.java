/*
 * FactSet Concordance API
 *   The FactSet Concordance API enables Application Developers and Data Scientists to programmatically discover the FactSet Identifier for a specific Entity or Person based on attributes, such as name, URL, and location.FactSet Identifiers are mapped to industry-standard identifiers, as well as to a comprehensive set of reference data and unique content, to enhance the ability to quickly connect content sets.<p>     Using the submitted attributes, the FactSet Concordance API leverages FactSetâ€™s extensive Entity Master, People, and Symbology databases to return potential candidate matches and a proposed match. The result is a concorded FactSet Identifier that can then be used as input throughout FactSet's expanding catalog of Content using our Content APIs or Standard DataFeeds.</p>    <b>There are two types of workflows supported in the API:</b>    <b>Entity & People Match:</b> The first workflow follows traditional API conventions in that a request is accepted and a response is returned synchronously enabling the concordance of up to 25 names in a single request. The response returns a list of 20 candidates as well as a proposed match.    <b>Entity & People Match - Bulk:</b> The second workflow allows you to input a large list of names within a .CSV file in a single request. With this workflow, a task is created for uploading a set of queries. Once the task has completed, the client retrieves the concordance results through the /entity-decisions or /people-decisions endpoint. Note that in the Bulk workflow, only the matches for the records are returned. Candidates are not included.    Once the service has provided a list of concorded FactSet Identifiers, you can then use our Entity Mappings and People Mappings endpoints to further review the universe of mapped identifiers or modify existing records. </p><p><b>Rate limit is set to 10 requests per second</b>.</p>    Methodology Guide link:   [https://open.factset.com/api/public/media/download/products/documents/8ca33e81-a7da-4d77-a8cf-2b3a2e868b3d](https://open.factset.com/api/public/media/download/products/documents/8ca33e81-a7da-4d77-a8cf-2b3a2e868b3d)

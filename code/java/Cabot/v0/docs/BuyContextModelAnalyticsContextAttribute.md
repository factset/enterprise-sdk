# BuyContextModelAnalyticsContextAttribute

Context analysis graphically depicts a managerâ€™s actual decisions both to describe how decisions are made and how they ultimately impact results. This model enables a manager to explore the consistency of his/her buy process in addition to the effectiveness of new buys with regard to fundamental attributes (e.g., EPS, ROI, debt to asset, etc.) as well as client provided proprietary attributes.

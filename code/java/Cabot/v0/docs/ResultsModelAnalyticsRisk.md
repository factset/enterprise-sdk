## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**alpha** | **BigDecimal** | Alpha describes portfolio results adjusted for style and market factors. It provides insight into portfolio management independent from whether its style was in favor or out of favor (i.e., benefiting from a tailwind or fighting a headwind). |  [optional]
**beta** | **BigDecimal** | Beta is also referred to as systematic risk, in that it expresses portfolio volatility in relationship to market or benchmark volatility. A beta of greater than 1.0 indicates that the portfolio is being managed in such a way that it exhibits more systemic risk than its benchmark and vice versa. |  [optional]
**rSquared** | **BigDecimal** | In investing, R squared is generally interpreted as the percentage of a portfolio&#39;s movements that can be explained by movements in the benchmark. An R squared of 1.0 implies that the portfolio&#39;s return is completely explained by movements in the benchmark. |  [optional]

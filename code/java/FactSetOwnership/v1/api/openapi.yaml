    FactSet's Fund Ownership API gives access to both **Holdings** and **Holders** data.<p> Factset's Holdings endpoints gives access to all the underlying securities and their position detils held within a given fund. Fund Types supported include Open-End Mutual Funds, Closed-end Mutual Funds, and Exchange Traded Funds. Security Holders information retrieves all "holder types" and their positions across institutions, funds, insiders, and stakeholders.</p><p>The FactSet Ownership and Mutual Funds database collects global equity ownership data for approximately 50,000 institutions, 60,000 unique Mutual Fund portfolios, and 400,000 Insider/Stake holders from around 110 countries.  For more details review our [Data Collection](https://my.apps.factset.com/oa/cms/oaAttachment/87e162be-f2d1-4f40-a85b-bfb1b020d270/20079) methodology. </p>

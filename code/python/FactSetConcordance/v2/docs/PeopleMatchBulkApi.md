# **get_people_task_for_list**
> PeopleTaskResponse get_people_task_for_list(universe_id, task_name, input_file, client_id_column, entity_column)

Create a People Concordance Task.

The \"Bulk\" workflow allows the user to create a People Concordance Task. Uploading of a Comma-Separated List file (.csv / UTF-8 encoding) with a list of names and attributes and creation of a task id is mandatory to start the process. [Concordance Sample People Template](https://my.apps.factset.com/oa/cms/oaAttachment/8bd62c75-8f78-48c0-a27d-9cd186c9a54a/27317)    The taskId is then used for reference in the /people-task-status and /people-decisions endpoints to receive results once the task is successful.The /people-task-status endpoint is to check the status of the Tasks as per the ids.     A universeId must be included in request. If you do not have a universe created, reference the /universe endpoint.The bulk workflow supports a two way approach for the user.   **The user can use these parameters in the following ways.**     1.Filling all the required fields including the `personNameColumn`.(do not include `firstNameColumn`,`lastNameColumn` & `middleNameColumn`)     2.Filling all the required fields excluding the `personNameColumn`.(Ensure atleast the `lastNameColumn` is filled)

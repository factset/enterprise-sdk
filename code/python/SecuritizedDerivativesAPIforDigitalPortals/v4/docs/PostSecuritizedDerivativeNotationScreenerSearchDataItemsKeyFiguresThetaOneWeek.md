# PostSecuritizedDerivativeNotationScreenerSearchDataItemsKeyFiguresThetaOneWeek

Weekly theta. It represents the first partial derivative of the function determining the derivative notation's theoretical price with respect to the residual term, evaluated at the current residual term and multiplied by 7 / 365. Weekly theta indicates the absolute change (decrease) of the price of a derivative for a reduction of the residual term by one week (seven calendar days), thus it represents the price sensitivity of the derivative relative to changes in the residual term. This key figure is calculated for plain vanilla warrants only.

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**effective** | **float, none_type** | Weekly theta calculated using the actual cover ratio of the securitized derivative. | [optional] 
**unadjusted** | **float, none_type** | Weekly theta calculated using a (hypothetical) cover ratio of 1:1. | [optional] 
**any string name** | **bool, date, datetime, dict, float, int, list, str, none_type** | any string name can be used but the value must be the correct type | [optional]

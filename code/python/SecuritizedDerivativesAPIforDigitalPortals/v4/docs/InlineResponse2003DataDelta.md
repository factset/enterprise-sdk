# InlineResponse2003DataDelta

Ask-based delta. It represents the first partial derivative of the function determining the derivative notation's theoretical price with respect to the underlying level, evaluated at the underlying level. Delta indicates the ratio of the absolute change of the price of a derivative for an indefinitely small absolute change in the underlying level, thus it represents the price sensitivity of the derivative relative to changes in the underlying level. This key figure is calculated for plain vanilla warrants only.

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**effective** | **float, none_type** | Delta calculated using the actual cover ration of the securitized derivative. | [optional] 
**unadjusted** | **float, none_type** | Delta calculated using a (hypothetical) cover ratio of 1:1. | [optional] 
**any string name** | **bool, date, datetime, dict, float, int, list, str, none_type** | any string name can be used but the value must be the correct type | [optional]

# PostSecuritizedDerivativeNotationScreenerSearchRequestDataKeyFiguresParity

Value range of the parity. It represents the difference between the underlying level and the strike of the derivative, adjusted for the cover ratio and the currency cross rate. Negative values are possible. It is the gain or loss that would result from the immediate exercise of an already present warrant and a simultaneously executed compensation transaction on the spot markets. This key figure is calculated for plain vanilla warrants only.

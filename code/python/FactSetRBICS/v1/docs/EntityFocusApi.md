Get RBICS classification for the Focus industry

Gets RBICS classifications for the Focus industry for a short list of companies. Full history is included if _date_ parameter is not specified.      RBICS Focus offers a single-sector mapping of about 48,000 of the most liquid and publicly-traded companies based on their primary lines of business; it uses revenues as the key factor in determining a company’s primary line of business, by mapping a company to the lowest-level sector from which it derives 50% or more of its revenues.    The RBICS Extended Universe – Industry Group is not currently supported through the RBICS API.

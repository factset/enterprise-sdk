# **get_funds_returns**
> FundsReturnsResponse get_funds_returns(ids)

Get Fund Returns for a requested time-series

Get Fund NAV Returns over a time-series for the requested date range and frequency. <p>The simple Total Return NAV shows the fund's total return level by reinvesting distributions so that ex-date NAVs are increased by the distribution amount and compounded thereafter. Total return NAV compounds daily and is calculated from the first available NAV date of each fund. The total return NAV series reflects the value that an investor would own if it had purchased one share at the inception date and reinvested all dividends on a Gross basis.</p><p> Control the dividends to include or exclude using the dividendAdjust parameter. The first available NAV date of each fund can be found in the /summary endpoint as `priceFristDate`. Visit [OA #21437](https://my.apps.factset.com/oa/pages/21437) for more details.</p>

Get Fund Returns for a user-defined date range

Get Fund Returns between a specified startDate and endDate. The service will compute the return between those two periods to retrieve the single value and does not create a time-series. Control the return type to include or exclude dividends by using the dividendAdjust parameter.

# **get_related_funds**
> RelatedFundsResponse get_related_funds(ids)

Get a list of Related Funds for a list of Fund ids.

Fetch the five related fund share classes. Fund share classes can be related if they belong to the same Fund Classification segment, have the same share class type, have the same legal structure, and have the same country of primary exchange. Beyond the baseline criteria, the five most relevant funds are determined based on whether they follow the same benchmark, have the same maturity, and have the same selection strategy as the specified share class.

### HTTP response details

| Status code | Description | Response headers |

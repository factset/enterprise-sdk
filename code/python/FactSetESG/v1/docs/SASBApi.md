# **get_sasb_ranks**
> SasbRanksResponse get_sasb_ranks(ids)

Gets ESG Rankings for a requested list of ids and dates.

Indicates if a company is a Leader, Above Average, Average, Below Average, or a Laggard; directly mapping from Industry Percentiles (*request IND_PCTL in scores endpoints*). Mapping of ESG Ranks to Industry Percentile Ranges is as follows -   |Rank|Industry Percentile Range (%)| |---|---| |Leader|90 - 100| |Above Average|70 - 89.9| |Average|30 - 69.9| |Below Average|10 - 29.9| |Laggard|0 - 9.9|  Industry classifications follow SICS, SASB's Industry Classification System. Using the Adjusted Insight scores, Industry Percentiles are generated for all companies. Companies with five or more articles in a year get ranked in a first pass, then companies with filled-in values are interpolated without forcing the ranking of higher-volume companies up or down.  In the case where a company falls into an industry with fewer than 7 high or medium volume companies the Sector Percentile is inserted in the place of the Industry Percentile score. <p>Only Vaild for ALLCATEGORIES and MATERIALITY categories.</p>

# **get_sasb_scores**
> SasbScoresResponse get_sasb_scores(ids)

Gets short-term, long-term, and momentum scores based on the 26 ESG categories defined by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB).

FactSet Truvalue Labs SASB Scores provides short-term, long-term, and momentum scores that are generated for 26 ESG categories defined by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board. FactSet Truvalue also calculates a custom overall score called ALLCATEGORIES, can indicate data volume flow, and the Dynamic Materiality of that data flow.

To specify select scores returned in the response, provide a comma-separated list of the scores using the description below. <p>These scores use the same underlying data and 100-point scale, except for ranks and percentiles. The cognitive computing system behind FactSet's Truvalue Platform uses natural language processing to interpret semantic content and generate analytics. It does so by applying criteria that are consistent with established sustainability and ESG frameworks, scoring data points on performance using a 0 to 100 scale. A score of 50 represents a neutral impact. Scores above 50 indicate positive performance, and scores below reflect negative performance.</p>  ### ESG Score Types  |**SASB Category Input**|**Description**| |---|---| |**PULSE**|*Pulse Score*, is a measure of near-term performance changes that highlights opportunities and controversies, enabling real-time monitoring of companies. It focuses on events of the day and provides a responsive signal to alert investors to dynamic moves.| |**INSIGHT**|*Insight Score*, a measure of a company’s longer-term ESG track record, similar to a ratings system. Scores are less sensitive to daily events and reflect the enduring performance record of a company over time. Scores are derived using an exponentially-weighted moving average of the Pulse, defined below, and the half-life of an event’s influence on the overall score is 6 months.| |**MOMENTUM**|*Momentum Score*, measures the trend of a company's Insight score. It is a unique ESG metric in the industry that gives investors a high-precision view of the trajectory of a company’s ESG performance, relative to peers. It does so by precisely articulating upward or downward movement, relative to that of all others in the universe, making it a measure that enhances quantitative workflows.| |**ART_VOL_TTM**|*Article Volume Score*, measures the information flow or number of articles about a company over the past 12 months.| |**CAT_VOL_TTM**|*Category Volume Score*, returns the total number of times any of the 26 categories received a score over a trailing twelve-month (TTM) period of time.| |**DYNAMIC_MAT**|*Dynamic Materiality Score*, shows the percentage value of data flow by category compared with the total data flow for the organization **(NOT VALID for `ALLCATEGORIES` and `MATERIALITY` category types).**| |**ADJ_INSIGHT**|*Adjusted Insight*, Measures company ESG performance, generating scores for lower-volume and zero-volume firms by blending company scores with industry medians. **(ONLY Vaild for `ALLCATEGORIES` and `MATERIALITY` categories). <p>**Adjusted Insight Score = (# of articles / 5) x Company Insight Score + ((5 - # of articles) / 5) x Industry (or Sector) Median Insight Score.</p>| |**IND_PCTL**|*Industry Percentile*, offers context on company Adjusted Insight scores relative to peers in the same SICS Industry. This value is used to establish the textual ESG Rank. **(ONLY Vaild for `ALLCATEGORIES` and `MATERIALITY` categories).**|  ### Helper Input **ALL**= *Ability to fetch all of the \"scoreTypes\" listed above in a simplified query.* This is used by default and removes the need to explitly request each scoreType in the list.  (optional) if omitted the server will use the default value of ["ALL"]
    categories = ["AIRQUALITY","BUSINESSETHICS","HUMANRIGHTSANDCOMRELS"] # [str] | The SASB Categories requested for the respective scoreType(s). The default value is **ALLCATEGORIES**, which represents all 26 categories in a single overall score. To request a specifc category or list of categories, simply input the category names below.   ### SASB Categories |**SASB Category Inputs**|**Description**| |---|---| |**ALLCATEGORIES**|**All Categories** - this category represents a company's overall SASB Score for the specific 'scoreType'. This value is equal to the cumulative average of all 26 SASB categories for the specific 'scoreType'.*Note that category is not available for the Dynamic Materiality 'scoreType'. |**ACCESSANDAFFORDABILITY**|**Access and Affordability** - The category addresses a company's ability to ensure broad access to its products and services, specifically in the context of underserved markets and/or population groups.

# **get_sasb_scores_all**
> SasbScoresAllResponse get_sasb_scores_all(ids)

Gets a flat key value array of scores for named categories of the input scoreType(s).

**Retrieves a flat array of all categories for the requested scoreType and ids. Unlike the /sasb-scores endpoint the format of the response returns category names as part of the key value.**<p> Gets values for all categories for the selected score type(s) for the requested identifier(s). FactSet Truvalue Labs SASB Scores provides short-term, long-term, and momentum scores that are generated for 26 ESG categories defined by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board. ESG Ranks are not supported in this Endpoint.

It is a unique ESG metric in the industry that gives investors a high-precision view of the trajectory of a company’s ESG performance, relative to peers. It does so by precisely articulating upward or downward movement, relative to that of all others in the universe, making it a measure that enhances quantitative workflows.| |**ART_VOL_TTM**|*Article Volume Score*, measures the information flow or number of articles about a company over the past 12 months.| |**CAT_VOL_TTM**|*Category Volume Score*, returns the total number of times any of the 26 categories received a score over a trailing twelve-month (TTM) period of time.| |**DYNAMIC_MAT**|*Dynamic Materiality Score*, shows the percentage value of data flow by category compared with the total data flow for the organization **(NOT VALID for `ALLCATEGORIES` and `MATERIALITY` category types).**| |**ADJ_INSIGHT**|*Adjusted Insight*, Measures company ESG performance, generating scores for lower-volume and zero-volume firms by blending company scores with industry medians. **(ONLY Vaild for `ALLCATEGORIES` and `MATERIALITY` categories). <p>**Adjusted Insight Score = (# of articles / 5) x Company Insight Score + ((5 - # of articles) / 5) x Industry (or Sector) Median Insight Score.</p>| |**IND_PCTL**|*Industry Percentile*, offers context on company Adjusted Insight scores relative to peers in the same SICS Industry.

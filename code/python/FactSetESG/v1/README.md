FactSet ESG (powered by FactSet Truvalue Labs) applies machine learning to uncover risks and opportunities from companies' Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) behavior, which are aggregated and categorized into continuously updated, material ESG scores. The service focuses on company ESG behavior from external sources and includes both positive and negative events that go beyond traditional sources of ESG risk data.<p> FactSet ESG extracts, analyzes, and generates scores from millions of documents each month collected from more than 100,000 data sources in over 30 languages. Sources include news, trade journals, NGOs, watchdog groups, trade blogs, industry reports and social media. Products deliver investable insights by revealing value and risk factors from unstructured data at the speed of current events.</p>

```

### Using Pandas

To convert an API response to a Pandas DataFrame, it is necessary to transform it first to a dictionary.
```python
import pandas as pd

response_dict = api_response.to_dict()['data']

simple_json_response = pd.DataFrame(response_dict)
nested_json_response = pd.json_normalize(response_dict)
```

### Debugging

The SDK uses the standard library [`logging`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#module-logging) module.

Setting `debug` to `True` on an instance of the `Configuration` class sets the log-level of related packages to `DEBUG`
and enables additional logging in Pythons [HTTP Client](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.client.html).

**Note**: This prints out sensitive information (e.g. the full request and response). Use with care.

```python
import logging
import fds.sdk.FactSetESG

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

configuration = fds.sdk.FactSetESG.Configuration(...)
configuration.debug = True
```

### Configure a Proxy

You can pass proxy settings to the Configuration class:

* `proxy`: The URL of the proxy to use.
* `proxy_headers`: a dictionary to pass additional headers to the proxy (e.g. `Proxy-Authorization`).

```python
import fds.sdk.FactSetESG

configuration = fds.sdk.FactSetESG.Configuration(
    # ...
    proxy="http://secret:password@localhost:5050",
    proxy_headers={
        "Custom-Proxy-Header": "Custom-Proxy-Header-Value"
    }
)
```

### Custom SSL Certificate

TLS/SSL certificate verification can be configured with the following Configuration parameters:

* `ssl_ca_cert`: a path to the certificate to use for verification in `PEM` format.
* `verify_ssl`: setting this to `False` disables the verification of certificates.
  Disabling the verification is not recommended, but it might be useful during
  local development or testing.

```python
import fds.sdk.FactSetESG

configuration = fds.sdk.FactSetESG.Configuration(
    # ...
    ssl_ca_cert='/path/to/ca.pem'
)
```

### Request Retries

In case the request retry behaviour should be customized, it is possible to pass a `urllib3.Retry` object to the `retry` property of the Configuration.

```python
from urllib3 import Retry
import fds.sdk.FactSetESG

configuration = fds.sdk.FactSetESG.Configuration(
    # ...
)

configuration.retries = Retry(total=3, status_forcelist=[500, 502, 503, 504])
```

## Notes for Large OpenAPI documents
If the OpenAPI document is large, imports in fds.sdk.FactSetESG.apis and fds.sdk.FactSetESG.models may fail with a
RecursionError indicating the maximum recursion limit has been exceeded. In that case, there are a couple of solutions:

Solution 1:
Use specific imports for apis and models like:
- `from fds.sdk.FactSetESG.api.default_api import DefaultApi`
- `from fds.sdk.FactSetESG.model.pet import Pet`

Solution 2:
Before importing the package, adjust the maximum recursion limit as shown below:
```
import sys
sys.setrecursionlimit(1500)
import fds.sdk.FactSetESG
from fds.sdk.FactSetESG.apis import *
from fds.sdk.FactSetESG.models import *
```

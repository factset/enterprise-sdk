The data can also be requested for individual sub topic codes in addition to the indicators mentioned below -    |**SFDR PAI Indicators**|**Description**| |---|---| |**MandatoryIndicators**| Mandatory indicators are the indicators which must be reported under the EU Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR).| |**AdditionalIndicators**| These are additional environmental and social indicators as mentioned in additional tables as provided in the Annex 1 table in the SFDR RTS report.| |**GHGEmissions**| This mandatory indicator includes metrics related to greenhouse emissions such as - Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions, footprint and intensity and energy consumption from non-renewable and high climate sectors.| |**Biodiversity**| This mandatory indicator includes metrics pertaining to biodiversity and a company's impacts on biodiversity-sensitive areas.| |**Water**| This mandatory indicator includes data relating to emissions to water as made by the companies.| |**Waste**| This mandatory indicator includes data relating to hazardous waste as generated by the companies.| |**SocialEmployeeMatters**| This mandatory indicator includes employee-related metrics like gender diversity, pay gap and social-related metrics like violation of UNGC/OECD principles and exposure to controversial weapons.| |**Emissions**| This additional indicator includes metrics related to air pollutants, inorganic pollutants and ozone depleting substance. | |**EnergyPerformance**| This additional indicator includes metrics related to various sources of non-renewable energy as used by the companies. | |**WaterWasteMaterialEmissions**| This mandatory indicator includes employee-related metrics like gender diversity, pay gap and social-related metrics like violation of UNGC/OECD principles and exposure to controversial weapons.| |**AdditionalEmployeeMatters**| This additional indicator includes metrics related to workplace discrimination and safety, whistleblower mechanism and supplier code of conduct.| |**HumanRights**| This additional indicator includes metrics related to both policies and performance of a company in the areas of human rights, forced labor and human trafficking.| |**AntiCorruptionAntiBribery**| This additional indicator includes data related to company violations of anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, and resulting fines.|

# TvlScoreType

The FactSet Truvalue Score types being requested. Score Types include the Pulse, Insight, Momentum, Article Volume, Category Volume, Dynamic Materiality Score, Adjusted Insight, and Industry Percentile. When left blank `Ranks` score type will be returned for the requested Id. <p>These scores use the same underlying data and 100-point scale, except for ranks. The cognitive computing system behind FactSet's Truvalue Platform uses natural language processing to interpret semantic content and generate analytics. It does so by applying criteria that are consistent with established sustainability and SASB frameworks, scoring data points on performance using a 0 to 100 scale. A score of 50 represents a neutral impact. Scores above 50 indicate positive performance, and scores below reflect negative performance. <br>**Note** : Only one score type can be queried per request.</p> ### Truvalue Score Types  |**Truvalue Score Type Input**|**Description**| |---|---| |**PULSE**|*Pulse Score* is a measure of near-term performance changes that highlights opportunities and controversies, enabling real-time monitoring of companies.| |**PULSE_PCTL**|*Pulse Percentile* offers context on company Pulse Scores relative to peers in the same SICS Industry.| |**INSIGHT**|*Insight Score* a measure of a company’s longer-term ESG track record.| |**INSIGHT_PCTL**|*Insight Percentile* offers context on company Insight Scores relative to peers in the same SICS Industry **(NOT VALID for TOPLEVEL(i.e., `ALLCATEGORIES` and `MATERIALITY` fields)).**| |**MOMENTUM**|*Momentum Score* measures the trend of a company's Insight score, over a trailing twelve month period.| |**DYN_MATERIALITY**|*Dynamic Materiality Score*, shows the percentage value of data flow by category compared with the total data flow for the organization **(NOT VALID for TOPLEVEL(i.e., `ALLCATEGORIES` and `MATERIALITY` fields)).**| |**ARTVOL_DAY**|*Article Volume Score* measures the information flow or number of articles about a company on daily basis.| |**CATVOL_DAY**|*Category Volume Score* returns the total number of times any of the 26 categories received on a daily basis.| |**ARTVOL_TTM**|*Article Volume Score* measures the information flow or number of articles about a company over the past 12 months.| |**CATVOL_TTM**|*Category Volume Score* returns the total number of times any of the 26 categories received a score over a trailing twelve-month (TTM) period of time.| |**ARTVOL_TOT**|*The Article Volume Score* for all 26 SASB Categories, measures the information flow or number of articles for a company throughout the entire history.| |**CATVOL_TOT**|*The Category Volume Score* for all 26 SASB Categories, measures the information flow or number of category tags for a company throughout the entire history.| |**RANKS**|Indicates if a company is a Leader, Above Average, Average, Below Average, or a Laggard; directly mapping from Industry Percentiles (request IND_PCTL in scores endpoints). <p><br> **ADJ_INSIGHT** *Adjusted Insight* scores which measure a company's SASB performance, generating scores for lower volume and zero-volume firms by blending company scores with industry medians.  **(ONLY VALID for TOPLEVEL(i.e.,`ALLCATEGORIES` and `MATERIALITY` categories)).** <p> **Adjusted Insight Score = (# of articles / 5) x Company Insight Score + ((5 - # of articles) / 5) x Industry (or Sector) Median Insight Score  .<p> <br> **IND_PCTL** *Industry Percentiles* to gauge  Adjusted Insight scores relative to peers and easy to  decipher fields ranking companies from Laggards to Leaders.  **(ONLY VALID for TOPLEVEL(i.e.,`ALLCATEGORIES` and `MATERIALITY` categories)).** <p> Mapping of Ranks to Industry Percentile Ranges is as follows -                      Rank           | Industry Percentile Range                      -------------- | -------------------------                      Leader         | 90 - 100                                       Above Average  | 70 - 89.9                                      Average        | 30 - 69.9                                      Below Average  | 10 - 29.9                                      Laggard        | 0 - 9.9

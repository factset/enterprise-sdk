    FactSet ESG API

    FactSet ESG (powered by FactSet Truvalue) applies Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning to uncover risks and opportunities from companies' Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) behavior, which are aggregated and categorized into continuously updated, material ESG scores. The service focuses on company ESG behavior from external sources and includes both positive and negative events that go beyond traditional sources of ESG risk data.<p> FactSet ESG extracts, analyzes, and generates scores from millions of documents each month collected from more than 200,000 data sources in over 38 languages. Sources include news, trade journals, NGOs, watchdog groups, trade blogs and industry reports. Products deliver investable insights by revealing value and risk factors from unstructured data at the speed of current events.</p>   # noqa: E501

It does so by applying criteria that are consistent with established sustainability and SASB frameworks, scoring data points on performance using a 0 to 100 scale. A score of 50 represents a neutral impact. Scores above 50 indicate positive performance, and scores below reflect negative performance. <br>**Note** : Only one score type can be queried per request.</p> ### Truvalue Score Types  |**Truvalue Score Type Input**|**Description**| |---|---| |**PULSE**|*Pulse Score* is a measure of near-term performance changes that highlights opportunities and controversies, enabling real-time monitoring of companies.| |**PULSE_PCTL**|*Pulse Percentile* offers context on company Pulse Scores relative to peers in the same SICS Industry.| |**INSIGHT**|*Insight Score* a measure of a company’s longer-term ESG track record.| |**INSIGHT_PCTL**|*Insight Percentile* offers context on company Insight Scores relative to peers in the same SICS Industry **(NOT VALID for TOPLEVEL(i.e., `ALLCATEGORIES` and `MATERIALITY` fields)).**| |**MOMENTUM**|*Momentum Score* measures the trend of a company's Insight score, over a trailing twelve month period.| |**DYN_MATERIALITY**|*Dynamic Materiality Score*, shows the percentage value of data flow by category compared with the total data flow for the organization **(NOT VALID for TOPLEVEL(i.e., `ALLCATEGORIES` and `MATERIALITY` fields)).**| |**ARTVOL_DAY**|*Article Volume Score* measures the information flow or number of articles about a company on daily basis.| |**CATVOL_DAY**|*Category Volume Score* returns the total number of times any of the 26 categories received on a daily basis.| |**ARTVOL_TTM**|*Article Volume Score* measures the information flow or number of articles about a company over the past 12 months.| |**CATVOL_TTM**|*Category Volume Score* returns the total number of times any of the 26 categories received a score over a trailing twelve-month (TTM) period of time.| |**ARTVOL_TOT**|*The Article Volume Score* for all 26 SASB Categories, measures the information flow or number of articles for a company throughout the entire history.| |**CATVOL_TOT**|*The Category Volume Score* for all 26 SASB Categories, measures the information flow or number of category tags for a company throughout the entire history.| |**RANKS**|Indicates if a company is a Leader, Above Average, Average, Below Average, or a Laggard; directly mapping from Industry Percentiles (request IND_PCTL in scores endpoints). <p><br> **ADJ_INSIGHT** *Adjusted Insight* scores which measure a company's SASB performance, generating scores for lower volume and zero-volume firms by blending company scores with industry medians.  **(ONLY VALID for TOPLEVEL(i.e.,`ALLCATEGORIES` and `MATERIALITY` categories)).** <p> **Adjusted Insight Score = (# of articles / 5) x Company Insight Score + ((5 - # of articles) / 5) x Industry (or Sector) Median Insight Score  .<p> <br> **IND_PCTL** *Industry Percentiles* to gauge  Adjusted Insight scores relative to peers and easy to  decipher fields ranking companies from Laggards to Leaders.  **(ONLY VALID for TOPLEVEL(i.e.,`ALLCATEGORIES` and `MATERIALITY` categories)).** <p> Mapping of Ranks to Industry Percentile Ranges is as follows -                      Rank           | Industry Percentile Range                      -------------- | -------------------------                      Leader         | 90 - 100                                       Above Average  | 70 - 89.9                                      Average        | 30 - 69.9                                      Below Average  | 10 - 29.9                                      Laggard        | 0 - 9.9   . if omitted defaults to "RANKS"  # noqa: E501
            _check_type (bool): if True, values for parameters in openapi_types
                                will be type checked and a TypeError will be
                                raised if the wrong type is input.
                                Defaults to True
            _path_to_item (tuple/list): This is a list of keys or values to
                                drill down to the model in received_data
                                when deserializing a response
            _spec_property_naming (bool): True if the variable names in the input data
                                are serialized names, as specified in the OpenAPI document.
                                False if the variable names in the input data
                                are pythonic names, e.g. snake case (default)
            _configuration (Configuration): the instance to use when
                                deserializing a file_type parameter.
                                If passed, type conversion is attempted
                                If omitted no type conversion is done.
            _visited_composed_classes (tuple): This stores a tuple of
                                classes that we have traveled through so that
                                if we see that class again we will not use its
                                discriminator again.
                                When traveling through a discriminator, the
                                composed schema that is
                                is traveled through is added to this set.
                                For example if Animal has a discriminator
                                petType and we pass in "Dog", and the class Dog
                                allOf includes Animal, we move through Animal
                                once using the discriminator, and pick Dog.
                                Then in Dog, we will make an instance of the
                                Animal class but this time we won't travel
                                through its discriminator because we passed in

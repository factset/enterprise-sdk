    FactSet ESG API

    FactSet ESG (powered by FactSet Truvalue) applies Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning to uncover risks and opportunities from companies' Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) behavior, which are aggregated and categorized into continuously updated, material ESG scores. The service focuses on company ESG behavior from external sources and includes both positive and negative events that go beyond traditional sources of ESG risk data.<p> FactSet ESG extracts, analyzes, and generates scores from millions of documents each month collected from more than 200,000 data sources in over 38 languages. Sources include news, trade journals, NGOs, watchdog groups, trade blogs and industry reports. Products deliver investable insights by revealing value and risk factors from unstructured data at the speed of current events.</p>   # noqa: E501

The three main pillars are Environmental, Social, and Governance. Each pillar encompasses several SASB categories that are thematically related. Pillars provide a broad framework for understanding and assessing a company's SASB performance and risks across these three fundamental areas.| |**DIMENSIONS**|Dimensions offer a more nuanced classification system for the 26 SASB categories, breaking them down into five distinct areas: **Environment, Business Model and Innovation, Human Capital, Leadership and Governance, and Social Capital**. This framework provides a more detailed and comprehensive view of a company's sustainability related activities, allowing for a more granular analysis of performance and risk across these five key dimensions of business operations and impact.| |**SASBCATEGORIES**| The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) has developed a comprehensive set of 26 sustainability-related business topics, often referred to as general sustainability issues. These categories are integral to SASB's Materiality Map, which identifies the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) issues most likely to be material for companies across different industries. The categories span crucial areas such as Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Air Quality, Energy Management, Water and Waste Management, Ecological Impacts, Human Rights, Labor Practices, Product Safety, Data Security, Business Ethics, and Systemic Risk Management, among others. Each category is crafted to capture specific sustainability risks and opportunities that may impact a company's financial condition, operating performance, or risk profile. By providing a standardized framework and leveraging the Materiality Map, SASB facilitates more effective communication between companies and investors regarding the sustainability matters most pertinent to financial performance. | .

The three main pillars are Environmental, Social, and Governance. Each pillar encompasses several SASB categories that are thematically related. Pillars provide a broad framework for understanding and assessing a company's SASB performance and risks across these three fundamental areas.| |**DIMENSIONS**|Dimensions offer a more nuanced classification system for the 26 SASB categories, breaking them down into five distinct areas: **Environment, Business Model and Innovation, Human Capital, Leadership and Governance, and Social Capital**. This framework provides a more detailed and comprehensive view of a company's sustainability related activities, allowing for a more granular analysis of performance and risk across these five key dimensions of business operations and impact.| |**SASBCATEGORIES**| The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) has developed a comprehensive set of 26 sustainability-related business topics, often referred to as general sustainability issues. These categories are integral to SASB's Materiality Map, which identifies the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) issues most likely to be material for companies across different industries. The categories span crucial areas such as Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Air Quality, Energy Management, Water and Waste Management, Ecological Impacts, Human Rights, Labor Practices, Product Safety, Data Security, Business Ethics, and Systemic Risk Management, among others. Each category is crafted to capture specific sustainability risks and opportunities that may impact a company's financial condition, operating performance, or risk profile. By providing a standardized framework and leveraging the Materiality Map, SASB facilitates more effective communication between companies and investors regarding the sustainability matters most pertinent to financial performance. | .

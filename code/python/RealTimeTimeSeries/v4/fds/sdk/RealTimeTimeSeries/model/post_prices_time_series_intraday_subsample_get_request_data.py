    Real-Time Time Series API

    Time series data, end-of-day or intraday, tick-by-tick or subsampled. Additional vendor-specific endpoints provide a modified interface for seamless integration with the ChartIQ chart library.  This API is focused on high-performance applications that are  * serving millions of end-users, * accessible by client browsers via the internet, * integrated into complex infrastructures such as existing frontend frameworks or authentication services.  This API has been designed for direct use by client web applications and feature extreme low latency: The average response time across all endpoints is 30 ms whereas 99% of all requests are answered in close to under 300ms.  See the [Real-Time Quotes API for Digital Portals](https://developer.factset.com/api-catalog/real-time-quotes-api) for access to detailed price information.   # noqa: E501

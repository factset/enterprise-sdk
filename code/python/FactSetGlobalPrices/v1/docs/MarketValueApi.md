### Parameters

Name | Type | Description  | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
 **ids** | **[str]**| The requested list of security identifiers.

In cases where the service allows for thousands of ids, which may lead to exceeding this request line limit of 8KB, it&#39;s advised for any requests with large request lines to be requested through the respective \&quot;POST\&quot; method.&lt;/p&gt;* |
 **batch** | **str**| Enables the ability to asynchronously \&quot;batch\&quot; the request, supporting a long-running request for up to 20 minutes. Upon requesting batch&#x3D;Y, the service will respond with an HTTP Status Code of 202. Once a batch request is submitted, use batch status to see if the job has been completed. Once completed, retrieve the results of the request via batch-result.  For single-day requests, the ids limit is 500 for non-batch and 2000 for batch.

### Return type

The endpoint generates varying objects correlating with the successful status code, encapsulated within a response wrapper housing the appropriate object. The response wrapper includes the subsequent response types:

**403** | The USERNAME-SERIAL attempted to request the endpoint is not authorized to access. The request was a legal request, but the server is refusing to respond. Please reach out to FactSet Account Team for assistance with authorization. |  -  |
**415** | Unsupported Media Type. This error may be returned when the caller sends a resource in a format that is not accepted by the server. This can be fixed by ensuring that Content-Type header is set to the correct value. In this instance, \&quot;application/json\&quot; would be the appropriate value. |  -  |
**500** | Internal Server Error. |  -  |

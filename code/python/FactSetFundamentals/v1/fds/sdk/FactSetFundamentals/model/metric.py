Double values have up to 15 digits of precision, while float values have up to 7 digits (integers have up to 10 digits).   * **float** - A float value is a real number (i.e., a number that can contain a fractional part/decimals). A float value has a precision up to seven digits and accurately represents numbers whose absolute value is less than 16,277,216 (224). An example metric includes   * **floatArray** - unction will hold data for multiple time-periods, as well as for many companies (i.e., two-dimensional value). The FLOATARRAY function returns data using a vertical orientation (e.g., down a column). The difference between FLOAT and FLOATARRAY is that FLOAT can only go across a row (one-dimension; horizontal orientation; vertical length=1) whereas FLOATARRAY will return data both across a row and down a column (two-dimensions; vertical orientation). With FLOATARRAY, the number of data points across a row will correspond to the number of companies queried; the number of data points down a column will correspond to the length of the time-series.   * **intArray** - An integer is a whole number or zero (i.e., integers do not include decimals). Integers can be positive or negative.   * **string** - A string value is an ASCII character. A string is a sequence of ASCII characters. String value and text value are synonymous.

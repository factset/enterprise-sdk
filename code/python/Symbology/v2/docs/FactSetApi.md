Translate market security symbols into FactSet Permanent Identifiers

Translate market security symbols into FactSet Permanent Security Identifiers. The permanent identifier provides a unique record key and a convenient way to link across content sets. Additionally, if your firm does not have licenses for the symbol systems (e.g., CUSIP, SEDOL, ISIN), the permanent identifier provides a way to deliver security and listing-level data.

Translate advanced symbol types into FactSet Permanent Identifiers

FactSet Advanced Symbology gives you enhanced resolution capabilities to translate a wider variety of input ids. Using the symbolType parameter, you are able to resolve from the below list of third-party identifier types into FactSet Permanent Identifiers. Any symbol types within this category MUST be declared by themselves to appropriately resolve.  * BIC - Bank Identification Code (e.g. ABXXHKH1) * CIK - Edgar Central Index Keys (e.g. 0000100331) * CRD - Central Registration Depository (e.g. 149722) * EIN - Employer Identification Number (e.g. 953540776) * FITCH - Fitch Ratings Identifier (e.g. 47504) * LEI - Legal Entity Identifier (e.g. 549300A6K7JX8EX2QZ33) * MD - Moody's Ratings Identifier (e.g. 0823736553) * SPR - S&P Ratings Identifier (e.g. 301939) * VALOREN - Valoren (\"Valor\") Identification (e.g. 685558) * WKN - German Securities Identification (\"Wert\") (e.g. A0MU9T) * UKCH - UK Company House Identifier(e.g.CE012494) * RSSD -   Federal Reserve RSSD Identifier(1139297)    Not providing a symbolType will use FactSet Advanced Unknown logic, allowing you to resolve a mix of ids across various input id types and asset classes (Equities, Debt Instruments, Companies, Portfolios, Market Listings, and more). Input Id Types include -  * FactSet Ticker, Ticker-Region, Ticker-Exchange * FactSet Permanent Identifiers (-R, -S, -L, -E) * CUSIP * SEDOL * ISIN * Bloomberg FIGI - Regional/Security/Listing Level * Bloomberg Ticker - Regional/Listing Level

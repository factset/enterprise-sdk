# **get_fixed_consensus**
> ConsensusResponse get_fixed_consensus(ids, metrics)

Retrieves consensus estimates for a requested list of ids and fixed fiscal periods

Returns FactSet Estimates consensus data using fixed fiscal dates. For example, if the company's current unreported year is 12/2020, all data returned by formulas that specify as the period/report basis will be for 12/2005 regardless of what perspective dates (startDate/endDate) are used. The fixed dates are \"locked\" in time and all estimated values are for that explicit date. If you are requesting that the estimated periods can change with the perspective date, please use the rolling-consensus endpoint.

# **get_rolling_consensus**
> ConsensusResponse get_rolling_consensus(ids, metrics)

Retrieves consensus estimates for a requested list of ids and rolling fiscal periods.

Returns FactSet Estimates consensus data using rolling fiscal dates. <p>The rolling behavior causes fiscal year to automatically roll from one year to the next as the historical perspective date changes. The fiscal period rolls forward as of each period end. This endpoint is optimized to allow the request to simply include a relative fiscal period (e.g. use relativeFiscalStart integer 1 and periodicity ANN for next unreported fiscal year end), and then see what the consensus thought the \"next fiscal year\" estimates were through time as you \"roll\" back your perspective dates. This differs from locking down an absolute estimate period such as explicitly stating Fiscal Year 2019. This can be done in the fixed-consensus endpoint.</p>

# **get_rolling_consensus_for_list**
> ConsensusResponse get_rolling_consensus_for_list(rolling_consensus_request)

Retrieves consensus estimates for a requested list of ids and rolling fiscal periods

Returns FactSet Estimates consensus data using rolling fiscal dates. <p>The rolling behavior causes fiscal year to automatically roll from one year to the next as the historical perspective date changes. The fiscal period rolls forward as of each period end. This endpoint is optimized to allow the request to simply include a relative fiscal period (e.g. use relativeFiscalStart integer 1 and periodicity ANN for next unreported fiscal year end), and then see what the consensus thought the \"next fiscal year\" estimates were through time as you \"roll\" back your perspective dates. This differs from locking down an absolute estimate period such as explicitly stating Fiscal Year 2019. This can be done in the fixed-consensus endpoint.</p> 

### Example

#### Example Code

```python

from fds.sdk.FactSetEstimates.api import consensus_api
from fds.sdk.FactSetEstimates.models import *
from dateutil.parser import parse as dateutil_parser
from pprint import pprint

# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.

# Examples for each supported authentication method are below,
# choose one that satisfies your use case.

# (Preferred) OAuth 2.0: FactSetOAuth2
# See https://github.com/FactSet/enterprise-sdk#oauth-20
# for information on how to create the app-config.json file
#
# The confidential client instance should be reused in production environments.
# See https://github.com/FactSet/enterprise-sdk-utils-python#authentication
# for more information on using the ConfidentialClient class

# See https://github.com/FactSet/enterprise-sdk#api-key
# for information how to create an API key
# configuration = fds.sdk.FactSetEstimates.Configuration(
#     username='USERNAME-SERIAL',
#     password='API-KEY'

# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with fds.sdk.FactSetEstimates.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = consensus_api.ConsensusApi(api_client)

    # NOTE: The following variables are just an example and may contain invalid values. Please, replace these with valid values.

# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.

# Examples for each supported authentication method are below,
# choose one that satisfies your use case.

# (Preferred) OAuth 2.0: FactSetOAuth2

# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with fds.sdk.FactSetEstimates.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:

# RelativeFiscalStartActuals

Relative fiscal period, expressed as an integer, used to filter results. This is combined with the periodicity parameter to specify a relative estimate period. FactSet Estimates Actuals provides data for past periods. Therefore, the input for `relativeFiscalStart` must be an integer that is zero or less. For example, set to 0 and periodicity to ANN to ask for the current reported year (FY0).

# RelativeFiscalEndActuals

Relative fiscal period, expressed as an integer, used to filter results. This is combined with the periodicity parameter to specify a relative estimate period.Therefore, the input for `relativeFiscalEnd` must be an integer that is zero or less. For example, set to -2 and periodicity to ANN to ask for two fiscal years before the latest (FY-2).

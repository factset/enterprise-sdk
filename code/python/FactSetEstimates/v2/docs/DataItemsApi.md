Available Estimate metrics

Returns list of available Estimate metrics that can be used in the `metrics` parameter of related endpoints. **By default, Factset provides Estimated items in millions. For specific metric methodology definitions, reference the `OAurl` response items to launch the available methodology page.**  

### Example

* Basic Authentication (FactSetApiKey):
* OAuth Authentication (FactSetOAuth2):

```python

# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.

# Examples for each supported authentication method are below,
# choose one that satisfies your use case.

# (Preferred) OAuth 2.0: FactSetOAuth2
# See https://github.com/FactSet/enterprise-sdk#oauth-20

# See https://github.com/FactSet/enterprise-sdk-utils-python#authentication
# for more information on using the ConfidentialClient class
configuration = fds.sdk.NaturalLanguageProcessing.Configuration(
    fds_oauth_client=ConfidentialClient('/path/to/app-config.json')
)

# Basic authentication: FactSetApiKey
# See https://github.com/FactSet/enterprise-sdk#api-key
# for information how to create an API key
# configuration = fds.sdk.NaturalLanguageProcessing.Configuration(
#     username='USERNAME-SERIAL',
#     password='API-KEY'
# )

# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with fds.sdk.NaturalLanguageProcessing.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:

        text="Advanced Energy Transforms Indoor Farming With Intelligent New Lighting Power and Control System Friday, December 11, 2020 01:00:00 PM (GMT)Innovative technology breaks down barriers to indoor, vertical and greenhouse farming by reducing power consumption, cutting costs and increasing crop yield Advanced Energy (Nasdaq: AEIS) – a global leader in highly engineered, precision power conversion, measurement, and control solutions – today unveiled its newest lighting and power control system for indoor, vertical and greenhouse farming. This press release features multimedia. Advanced Energy's new Artesyn iTS provides the industry's first solution for switching or sharing a single power source between two different rooms. This reduces installation costs by cutting the number of iHP power supplies needed in half and it substantially reduces ongoing utility costs. (Photo: Business Wire)AE's new lighting and power system transforms the use of LED technology in horticultural lighting systems, which plays a fundamental role in cutting-edge farming practices that can address production challenges in food, pharmaceutical ingredients, plants and flowers. Utilizing AE's system, customers reduce their power conversion costs by as much as 50 percent, significantly lower installation and operating costs, and increase the quality of crop yield. "Our groundbreaking lighting, power and control system delivers significant improvements over conventional lighting solutions and opens up new opportunities for the industry," said Joe Voyles, vice president, industrial marketing, at Advanced Energy. "We are transforming our customers' operations by both reducing the amount of needed equipment and improving the efficiency of the lighting systems, thereby reducing cost and energy spend. Not only do these innovative new products increase the efficiency and quality of fruit and vegetable production, but they also open the door to establishing indoor farming facilities in harsh environments anywhere in the world." The new system consists of the patented Artesyn iTS (intelligent Transfer Switch) and iHPS configurable power supply. Alongside Artesyn's compact new 12 kW 300 VDC module, AE delivers a cost-effective platform for the most advanced indoor farming applications. The system is estimated to produce a 38 percent savings to lighting power and control installation cost, while eliminating substantial amounts of wasted energy. The new iHPS is a "short" version of AE's market-leading iHP power supply. The shorter design allows for more space within the lighting and power cabinet for other crucial components, reduces the weight and cost, and increases the life of the system. The new iTS provides the industry's first solution for switching or sharing a single power source between two different rooms. This reduces installation costs by cutting the number of iHP power supplies needed in half and it substantially reduces ongoing utility costs.",

## Notes for Large OpenAPI documents
If the OpenAPI document is large, imports in fds.sdk.NaturalLanguageProcessing.apis and fds.sdk.NaturalLanguageProcessing.models may fail with a
RecursionError indicating the maximum recursion limit has been exceeded. In that case, there are a couple of solutions:

Solution 1:
Use specific imports for apis and models like:
- `from fds.sdk.NaturalLanguageProcessing.api.default_api import DefaultApi`
- `from fds.sdk.NaturalLanguageProcessing.model.pet import Pet`

Solution 2:
Before importing the package, adjust the maximum recursion limit as shown below:
```
import sys
sys.setrecursionlimit(1500)
import fds.sdk.NaturalLanguageProcessing
from fds.sdk.NaturalLanguageProcessing.apis import *
from fds.sdk.NaturalLanguageProcessing.models import *
```

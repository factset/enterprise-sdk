# Classifications

A map-like structure representing key-value pairs of custom classifications. This differs from the default classifications such as region and sector, for which we have different query parameters. If both are provided, the API will choose which one to use based on your portfolio.

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**any string name** | **str** | any string name can be used but the value must be the correct type | [optional]

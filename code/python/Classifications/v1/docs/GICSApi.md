Gets the GICS Direct Classifications

Gets the **Global Industry Classification Standard (\"GICS\")** Sectors, Industry Group, Industry, and Sub-Industry Names and Numbers for a requested list of ids and date range. All economic sectors have a two-digit identification code, all industry groups have a four-digit identification code, all industries have a six-digit identification code, and all sub-industries have an eight-digit identification code. To access the complete GICS structure and definitions, visit the [MSCI GICS](https://www.msci.com/gics) or [S&P GICS](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/landing/topic/gics/) home pages. Coverage includes over 37,000 securities. *Licensing for GICS Classifications, Regions, and History is required in addition to FactSet API license. Reach out to your FactSet Account Team for assistance.*

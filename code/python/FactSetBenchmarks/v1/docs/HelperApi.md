------------- | ------------- | -------------
[**get_benchmark_ids**](HelperApi.md#get_benchmark_ids) | **GET** /factset-benchmarks/v1/id-list | Returns a sample list of Benchmark Identifiers and the benchmark categorization to use in other Benchmark API endpoints.
[**get_benchmark_ids_for_list**](HelperApi.md#get_benchmark_ids_for_list) | **POST** /factset-benchmarks/v1/id-list | Returns a sample list of Benchmark Identifiers and the benchmark categorization to use in other Benchmark API endpoints.



# **get_benchmark_ids**
> BenchmarkIdListResponse get_benchmark_ids()

Returns a sample list of Benchmark Identifiers and the benchmark categorization to use in other Benchmark API endpoints.

Returns a **sample** list of Benchmark Identifiers to use in other Benchmark API endpoints. This is a supporting API to be use alongside the other Benchmark API endpoints. For example, use the fsymID value returned in this response as the input to your `ids` parameter in the /constituents endpoint to return constituents for that id.<p> *This is not the full list of benchmark ids allowed in this service, but rather a representation of the most commonly requested. For complete assistance with ID lookup or concordance services, please reach out to FactSet Support. *</p>

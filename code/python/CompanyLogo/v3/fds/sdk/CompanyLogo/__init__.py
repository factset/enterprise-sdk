    Company Logo API

    Consume FactSet collected Company Logos through an API that seamlessly integrates with company fundamentals and estimates data (listed equities data available via the stocks API), quotes, time series, and other Digital APIs.  The Logo API provides access to logos of US, CA and EU listed companies. The logos could be accessed by using national and international identifiers like ISIN, CUSIP, WKN, Valor, etc. and are a nice feature for comprehensive visualizations of equities on overview pages (factsheets).  Logos are reviewed/updated twice a year.  The Logo API for Digital Portals seamlessly integrates with the [Stocks API](https://developer.factset.com/api-catalog/stocks-api-digital-portals) for equities and estimates data and the [Quotes API](https://developer.factset.com/api-catalog/quotes-api-digital-portals), allowing access to detailed price and performance information of listings. The [Quotes API](https://developer.factset.com/api-catalog/quotes-api-digital-portals) also supports basic security identifier cross-reference (see for example /notation/crossReference/getByFactSetMarketSymbol to retrieve an instrument id). For direct access to price histories for charting, please refer to the [Time Series API for Digital Portals](https://developer.factset.com/api-catalog/time-series-api-digital-portals).   # noqa: E501

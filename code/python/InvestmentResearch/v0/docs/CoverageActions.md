# CoverageActions

One or more codes indicating coverage actions discussed in the document. The supported actions are:    - Drop - Permanent discontinuation of research coverage. No further updates or publications will be issued for the entity.      - Initiate - Formal commencement of research coverage. Typically includes an initial report and sets ongoing analytical attention.      - Resume - Reinstatement of previously suspended or dropped coverage. Research publication and updates resume for the entity.      - Suspend - Temporary halt in research coverage. No updates will be issued during this period, but coverage may be resumed later.       If this parameter is omitted, the result set is not filtered by coverage action, and the corresponding coverage action field and details are not returned in the response.

# Periodicities

One or more codes indicating the fixed time interval at which the document is published.   The supported periodicities:   - Annually - Document is published once every year.   - Daily - Document is published every day.   - EveryTwoWeeks - Document is published every two weeks (biweekly).   - Hourly - Document is published every hour.   - IntraDay - Document is published multiple times within the same day.   - Monthly - Document is published once every month.   - None - No fixed periodicity; publication is irregular or ad hoc.   - Other - Publication follows a custom or unspecified interval.   - Quarterly - Document is published once every quarter (every three months).   - SemiAnnually - Document is published twice a year.   - Weekly - Document is published once every week.    If this parameter is omitted, the result set is not filtered by periodicities, and the corresponding periodicities field and details are not returned in the response.

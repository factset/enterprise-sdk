# ResearchApproaches

One or more codes indicating the research perspective provided in the document.   The supported research approaches:   - Fundamental - Based on analysis of financial statements, industry conditions, and management quality to determine intrinsic value.   - Quantitative - Relies on statistical models, mathematical algorithms, and historical data to identify patterns and signals.   - Technical - Focuses on price charts, trading volume, and market trends to forecast future price movements.     If this parameter is omitted, the result set is not filtered by research approaches, and the corresponding research approaches field and details are not returned in the response.

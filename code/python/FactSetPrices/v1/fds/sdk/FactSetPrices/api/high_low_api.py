        Keyword Args:
            date (str): The as of date in **YYYY-MM-DD** format. This controls the perspective date in which the period parameter will be computed. If left blank, the API will default to previous close. Future dates (T+1) are not accepted in this endpoint. . [optional]
            period (str): The period of measure for the security's high and low pricing. This does not change display `frequency` but rather the underlying period. For example, if you wish to fetch the latest 52 week high and low price, select 52W. All periods are referencing actual periods of measure, not period-ends where-    * **D** = Daily   * **W** = Weekly, based on the last trading day of the week. Use the 52W for representing the latest year.   * **M** = Monthly, based on the start date (e.g., if the start date is June 16, data is displayed for June 16, May 16, April 16 etc.).   * **YTD** = Year-to-Date   * **Y** =  Actual Annual, based on the start date. . [optional] if omitted the server will use the default value of "52W"
            price_type (str): Controls whether price high and low data is returned intraday or at the close. For example, by selecting INTRADAY, if a security price reached an all time high of 10 during trading hours over the period of measure but closed that day at 8, then the service will return 10. If CLOSE was selected the service would return 8 if that was the high for the period measured. . [optional] if omitted the server will use the default value of "CLOSE"
            calendar (str): Calendar of data returned. SEVENDAY includes weekends. LOCAL calendar will default to the securities' trading calendar which excludes date records for respective holiday periods.. [optional] if omitted the server will use the default value of "FIVEDAY"
            currency (str): Currency code for adjusting prices. Default is Local. For a list of currency ISO codes, visit [Online Assistant Page 1470](https://oa.apps.factset.com/pages/1470).. [optional]
            adjust (str): Controls the split, spinoff, and dividend adjustments for the prices. <p>For more information, visit [Online Assistant Page 614](https://oa.apps.factset.com/pages/614)</p>   * **SPLIT** = Split ONLY Adjusted. This is used by default.   * **SPINOFF** = Splits & Spinoff Adjusted.   * **DIVADJ** = Splits, Spinoffs, and Dividends adjusted.   * **UNSPLIT** = No Adjustments. . [optional] if omitted the server will use the default value of "SPLIT"
            _preload_content (bool): if False, the urllib3.HTTPResponse object
                will be returned without reading/decoding response data.
                Default is True.
            _request_timeout (int/float/tuple): timeout setting for this request. If
                one number provided, it will be total request timeout. It can also
                be a pair (tuple) of (connection, read) timeouts.
                Default is None.
            _check_input_type (bool): specifies if type checking
                should be done one the data sent to the server.
                Default is True.
            _check_return_type (bool): specifies if type checking
                should be done one the data received from the server.
                Default is True.
            _spec_property_naming (bool): True if the variable names in the input data
                are serialized names, as specified in the OpenAPI document.
                False if the variable names in the input data
                are pythonic names, e.g. snake case (default)
            _content_type (str/None): force body content-type.
                Default is None and content-type will be predicted by allowed
                content-types and body.
            _host_index (int/None): specifies the index of the server
                that we want to use.

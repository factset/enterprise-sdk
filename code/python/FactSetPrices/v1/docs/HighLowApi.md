(optional) if omitted the server will use the default value of "52W"

For example, by selecting INTRADAY, if a security price reached an all time high of 10 during trading hours over the period of measure but closed that day at 8, then the service will return 10. If CLOSE was selected the service would return 8 if that was the high for the period measured.  (optional) if omitted the server will use the default value of "CLOSE"

# **get_security_returns**
> ReturnsResponse get_security_returns(ids)

Gets Returns for a list of `ids` as of given date range and rolling Period

The simple or compound return for the requested frequency and/or rollingPeriod. Depending on the input parameters the return will adjust accordingly. If you simply use frequency and no rollingPeriod, the return value will represent the frequency period. If you use rollingPeriod, the values will be returned in actual period ends (e.g. actual month, actual week, daily, etc.).

# **get_security_returns_for_list**

Requests security returns for the given date range and rollingPeriod.

The simple or compound return for the requested frequency and/or rollingPeriod. Depending on the input parameters the return will adjust accordingly. If you simply use frequency and no rollingPeriod, the return value will represent the frequency period. If you use rollingPeriod, the values will be returned in actual period ends (e.g. actual month, actual week, daily, etc.).

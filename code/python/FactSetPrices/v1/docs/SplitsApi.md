### HTTP request headers

 - **Content-Type**: Not defined

### HTTP response details

| Status code | Description | Response headers |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|
**200** | Array of security splits |  -  |
**400** | Bad Request. This can occur for several reasons. Please review the \&quot;message\&quot; for more details. |  -  |
**401** | Unauthenticated USERNAME-SERIAL. Ensure you are logged in and have successfully generated an API KEY for the IP range you are connecting from. For more help, select the **Report Issue** in the top right corner of this Developer Portal specification card and choose Connectivity 401 or 403 Responses. |  -  |
**403** | The USERNAME-SERIAL attempted to request the endpoint is not authorized to access. The request was a legal request, but the server is refusing to respond. Please reach out to FactSet Account Team for assistance with authorization. |  -  |
**415** | Unsupported Media Type. This error may be returned when the caller sends a resource in a format that is not accepted by the server. This can be fixed by ensuring that Content-Type header is set to the correct value. In this instance, \&quot;application/json\&quot; would be the appropriate value. |  -  |

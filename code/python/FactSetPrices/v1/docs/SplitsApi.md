### Example

* Basic Authentication (FactSetApiKey):
* OAuth Authentication (FactSetOAuth2):

```python
from fds.sdk.utils.authentication import ConfidentialClient
import fds.sdk.FactSetPrices
from fds.sdk.FactSetPrices.api import splits_api
from fds.sdk.FactSetPrices.models import *
from dateutil.parser import parse as dateutil_parser
from pprint import pprint

# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.

# Examples for each supported authentication method are below,
# choose one that satisfies your use case.

# (Preferred) OAuth 2.0: FactSetOAuth2
# See https://github.com/FactSet/enterprise-sdk#oauth-20
# for information on how to create the app-config.json file
# See https://github.com/FactSet/enterprise-sdk-utils-python#authentication
# for more information on using the ConfidentialClient class
configuration = fds.sdk.FactSetPrices.Configuration(
    fds_oauth_client=ConfidentialClient('/path/to/app-config.json')
)

# Basic authentication: FactSetApiKey
# See https://github.com/FactSet/enterprise-sdk#api-key
# for information how to create an API key
# configuration = fds.sdk.FactSetPrices.Configuration(
#     username='USERNAME-SERIAL',
#     password='API-KEY'
# )

# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with fds.sdk.FactSetPrices.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = splits_api.SplitsApi(api_client)

    # NOTE: The parameter variable defined below is just an example and may potentially contain non valid values. So please replace this with valid values.
    ids = ["AAPL-USA"] # [str] | The requested list of security identifiers. Accepted ID types include Market Tickers, SEDOL, ISINs, CUSIPs, or FactSet Permanent Ids. <p>***ids limit** =  2000 per request*</p> *<p>Make note, GET Method URL request lines are also limited to a total length of 8192 bytes (8KB). In cases where the service allows for thousands of ids, which may lead to exceeding this request line limit of 8KB, its advised for any requests with large request lines to be requested through the respective \"POST\" method.</p>*

    try:
        # Gets full history of security Splits for a list of `ids`
        # example passing only required values which don't have defaults set
        api_response = api_instance.get_security_splits(ids)

        pprint(api_response)

    except fds.sdk.FactSetPrices.ApiException as e:

### Parameters

Name | Type | Description  | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
 **ids** | **[str]**| The requested list of security identifiers. Accepted ID types include Market Tickers, SEDOL, ISINs, CUSIPs, or FactSet Permanent Ids. &lt;p&gt;***ids limit** &#x3D;  2000 per request*&lt;/p&gt; *&lt;p&gt;Make note, GET Method URL request lines are also limited to a total length of 8192 bytes (8KB).

### HTTP response details

| Status code | Description | Response headers |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|
**200** | Array of security splits |  -  |
**400** | Bad Request. This can occur for several reasons. Please review the \&quot;message\&quot; for more details. |  -  |
**401** | Unauthenticated USERNAME-SERIAL. Ensure you are logged in and have successfully generated an API KEY for the IP range you are connecting from. For more help, select the **Report Issue** in the top right corner of this Developer Portal specification card and choose Connectivity 401 or 403 Responses. |  -  |
**403** | The USERNAME-SERIAL attempted to request the endpoint is not authorized to access. The request was a legal request, but the server is refusing to respond. Please reach out to FactSet Account Team for assistance with authorization. |  -  |
**415** | Unsupported Media Type. This error may be returned when the caller sends a resource in a format that is not accepted by the server. This can be fixed by ensuring that Content-Type header is set to the correct value. In this instance, \&quot;application/json\&quot; would be the appropriate value. |  -  |

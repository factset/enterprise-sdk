### Example

* Basic Authentication (FactSetApiKey):
* OAuth Authentication (FactSetOAuth2):

```python
from fds.sdk.utils.authentication import ConfidentialClient
import fds.sdk.FactSetPrices
from fds.sdk.FactSetPrices.api import reference_api
from fds.sdk.FactSetPrices.models import *
from dateutil.parser import parse as dateutil_parser
from pprint import pprint

# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.

# Examples for each supported authentication method are below,
# choose one that satisfies your use case.

# (Preferred) OAuth 2.0: FactSetOAuth2
# See https://github.com/FactSet/enterprise-sdk#oauth-20
# for information on how to create the app-config.json file
# See https://github.com/FactSet/enterprise-sdk-utils-python#authentication
# for more information on using the ConfidentialClient class
configuration = fds.sdk.FactSetPrices.Configuration(
    fds_oauth_client=ConfidentialClient('/path/to/app-config.json')
)

# Basic authentication: FactSetApiKey
# See https://github.com/FactSet/enterprise-sdk#api-key
# for information how to create an API key
# configuration = fds.sdk.FactSetPrices.Configuration(
#     username='USERNAME-SERIAL',
#     password='API-KEY'
# )

# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with fds.sdk.FactSetPrices.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = reference_api.ReferenceApi(api_client)

    references_request = ReferencesRequest(
        ids=IdsMax2000(["FDS-US"]),
    ) # ReferencesRequest | Request object for `Security` prices.

    try:
        # Requests security reference details a list of securities
        # example passing only required values which don't have defaults set
        api_response = api_instance.get_security_reference_for_list(references_request)
        pprint(api_response)

    except fds.sdk.FactSetPrices.ApiException as e:
        print("Exception when calling ReferenceApi->get_security_reference_for_list: %s\n" % e)

Foreign Exchange Rates API in which retrieves Spots and Forwards for a given currency pair and date range. <p>*Spots and Forwards rates are sourced from W/M Reuters.The WM Company calculates daily standardized spot rates for global foreign exchange transactions, using rates provided by Reuters. These rates are recognized globally as the standard by banks, fund managers, and index compilers; increasingly these rates are also being used for benchmark currency trading. In 1994, WM Company began calculating closing spot rates. Closing spot rates provide a standard set of currency rates so that portfolio valuations can be compared to each other and their performances measured against benchmarks, without having discrepancies caused by exchange rates. Closing spot rates are recorded at 16:00 GMT.*</p>

    #     print("Exception when calling ForwardsApi->get_fx_forwards: %s\n" % e)

```

### Using Pandas

To convert an API response to a Pandas DataFrame, it is necessary to transform it first to a dictionary.
```python
import pandas as pd

response_dict = api_response.to_dict()['data']

simple_json_response = pd.DataFrame(response_dict)
nested_json_response = pd.json_normalize(response_dict)
```

### Debugging

The SDK uses the standard library [`logging`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#module-logging) module.

Setting `debug` to `True` on an instance of the `Configuration` class sets the log-level of related packages to `DEBUG`
and enables additional logging in Pythons [HTTP Client](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.client.html).

**Note**: This prints out sensitive information (e.g. the full request and response). Use with care.

```python
import logging
import fds.sdk.ForeignExchangeRate

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

configuration = fds.sdk.ForeignExchangeRate.Configuration(...)
configuration.debug = True
```

### Configure a Proxy

You can pass proxy settings to the Configuration class:

* `proxy`: The URL of the proxy to use.
* `proxy_headers`: a dictionary to pass additional headers to the proxy (e.g. `Proxy-Authorization`).

```python
import fds.sdk.ForeignExchangeRate

configuration = fds.sdk.ForeignExchangeRate.Configuration(
    # ...
    proxy="http://secret:password@localhost:5050",
    proxy_headers={
        "Custom-Proxy-Header": "Custom-Proxy-Header-Value"
    }
)
```

### Custom SSL Certificate

TLS/SSL certificate verification can be configured with the following Configuration parameters:

* `ssl_ca_cert`: a path to the certificate to use for verification in `PEM` format.
* `verify_ssl`: setting this to `False` disables the verification of certificates.
  Disabling the verification is not recommended, but it might be useful during
  local development or testing.

```python
import fds.sdk.ForeignExchangeRate

configuration = fds.sdk.ForeignExchangeRate.Configuration(
    # ...
    ssl_ca_cert='/path/to/ca.pem'
)
```

### Request Retries

In case the request retry behaviour should be customized, it is possible to pass a `urllib3.Retry` object to the `retry` property of the Configuration.

```python
from urllib3 import Retry
import fds.sdk.ForeignExchangeRate

configuration = fds.sdk.ForeignExchangeRate.Configuration(
    # ...
)

configuration.retries = Retry(total=3, status_forcelist=[500, 502, 503, 504])
```

## Notes for Large OpenAPI documents
If the OpenAPI document is large, imports in fds.sdk.ForeignExchangeRate.apis and fds.sdk.ForeignExchangeRate.models may fail with a
RecursionError indicating the maximum recursion limit has been exceeded. In that case, there are a couple of solutions:

Solution 1:
Use specific imports for apis and models like:
- `from fds.sdk.ForeignExchangeRate.api.default_api import DefaultApi`
- `from fds.sdk.ForeignExchangeRate.model.pet import Pet`

Solution 2:
Before importing the package, adjust the maximum recursion limit as shown below:
```
import sys
sys.setrecursionlimit(1500)
import fds.sdk.ForeignExchangeRate
from fds.sdk.ForeignExchangeRate.apis import *
from fds.sdk.ForeignExchangeRate.models import *
```

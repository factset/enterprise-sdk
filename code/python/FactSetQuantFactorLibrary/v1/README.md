Identify lucrative businesses relative to their industry, region, and size profile. Metrics are derived from FactSet Fundamentals and FactSet Estimates and include Return on Assets, Return on Invested Capital Change, and Return on Total Equity |Quality|Understand the overall financial health and quality of a company’s business. Use historical data from FactSet Fundamentals to analyze balance sheet health, stability of earnings and profit margins, variability in cash flows, and trends that look beyond headline financial metrics. Common metrics include Cash Earnings Ratio Variability, Revenue Stability, and Accruals Ratios. Composite quality scores (i.e., the Piotroski F-Score, Beneish M-Score, and Altman Z-Score) and their underlying components are also available as individual metrics.| |Solvency|Measure a company’s ability to meet their short- and long-term financial obligations and determine the degree of leverage employed to run their business.

```

### Using Pandas

To convert an API response to a Pandas DataFrame, it is necessary to transform it first to a dictionary.
```python
import pandas as pd

response_dict = api_response.to_dict()['data']

simple_json_response = pd.DataFrame(response_dict)
nested_json_response = pd.json_normalize(response_dict)
```

### Debugging

The SDK uses the standard library [`logging`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#module-logging) module.

Setting `debug` to `True` on an instance of the `Configuration` class sets the log-level of related packages to `DEBUG`
and enables additional logging in Pythons [HTTP Client](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.client.html).

**Note**: This prints out sensitive information (e.g. the full request and response). Use with care.

```python
import logging
import fds.sdk.FactSetQuantFactorLibrary

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

configuration = fds.sdk.FactSetQuantFactorLibrary.Configuration(...)
configuration.debug = True
```

### Configure a Proxy

You can pass proxy settings to the Configuration class:

* `proxy`: The URL of the proxy to use.
* `proxy_headers`: a dictionary to pass additional headers to the proxy (e.g. `Proxy-Authorization`).

```python
import fds.sdk.FactSetQuantFactorLibrary

configuration = fds.sdk.FactSetQuantFactorLibrary.Configuration(
    # ...
    proxy="http://secret:password@localhost:5050",
    proxy_headers={
        "Custom-Proxy-Header": "Custom-Proxy-Header-Value"
    }
)
```

### Custom SSL Certificate

TLS/SSL certificate verification can be configured with the following Configuration parameters:

* `ssl_ca_cert`: a path to the certificate to use for verification in `PEM` format.
* `verify_ssl`: setting this to `False` disables the verification of certificates.
  Disabling the verification is not recommended, but it might be useful during
  local development or testing.

```python
import fds.sdk.FactSetQuantFactorLibrary

configuration = fds.sdk.FactSetQuantFactorLibrary.Configuration(
    # ...
    ssl_ca_cert='/path/to/ca.pem'
)
```

### Request Retries

In case the request retry behaviour should be customized, it is possible to pass a `urllib3.Retry` object to the `retry` property of the Configuration.

```python
from urllib3 import Retry
import fds.sdk.FactSetQuantFactorLibrary

configuration = fds.sdk.FactSetQuantFactorLibrary.Configuration(
    # ...
)

configuration.retries = Retry(total=3, status_forcelist=[500, 502, 503, 504])
```

## Notes for Large OpenAPI documents
If the OpenAPI document is large, imports in fds.sdk.FactSetQuantFactorLibrary.apis and fds.sdk.FactSetQuantFactorLibrary.models may fail with a
RecursionError indicating the maximum recursion limit has been exceeded. In that case, there are a couple of solutions:

Solution 1:
Use specific imports for apis and models like:
- `from fds.sdk.FactSetQuantFactorLibrary.api.default_api import DefaultApi`
- `from fds.sdk.FactSetQuantFactorLibrary.model.pet import Pet`

Solution 2:
Before importing the package, adjust the maximum recursion limit as shown below:
```
import sys
sys.setrecursionlimit(1500)
import fds.sdk.FactSetQuantFactorLibrary
from fds.sdk.FactSetQuantFactorLibrary.apis import *
from fds.sdk.FactSetQuantFactorLibrary.models import *
```

Integrate variables from FactSet RBICS, FactSet Fundamentals, and FactSet Estimates to analyze growth rates over multiple horizons including Market Share, Sales, and EPS Growth| |Management|Gain insight into how management finances their business and the decisions they make that impact the core financial statements. These choices are reflected in changes to total debt or equity, the overall size of the balance sheet, and decisions around the accounting methods used. Metrics are derived from FactSet Fundamentals and FactSet Estimates and include Capital Expenditures (CAPEX) Growth, Equity Buyback Ratio, and Depreciation & Amortization Variability| |Profitability|Evaluate a company’s ability to generate income relative to its revenue or balance sheet metrics. Identify lucrative businesses relative to their industry, region, and size profile. Metrics are derived from FactSet Fundamentals and FactSet Estimates and include Return on Assets, Return on Invested Capital Change, and Return on Total Equity |Quality|Understand the overall financial health and quality of a company’s business. Use historical data from FactSet Fundamentals to analyze balance sheet health, stability of earnings and profit margins, variability in cash flows, and trends that look beyond headline financial metrics.

Common metrics include Current Ratio, Current Asset Liquidity, and Debt to Equity Change.| |Value|Quickly determine how cheap or expensive a company is based on common security-level characteristics from FactSet Prices, FactSet Fundamentals, and FactSet Estimates. Apply factors as an intersection between other factors for a more customized analysis, such as finding the cheapest stocks among the highest quality companies. Common metrics include Earnings Yield, Book to Price, and Revenue to Enterprise Value.| ### Macro and Cross-Asset |Group|Descriptions| |---|---| |Commodity|Quantify the impact movements in the commodity markets have on equity prices. Metrics are derived from FactSet Prices and allow you to measure company-level exposure to commodities such as Gold, Crude Oil, Coffee, and Live Cattle.| |FX_Sensitivity| Analyze security-level sensitivity to fluctuations in the currency markets. Metrics are derived from FactSet Prices and allow you to identify company exposures to currencies such as USD, EUR, JPY, and CNY. |Debt|Uncover details related to company debt through issuer-level factor exposures.

```

### Using Pandas

To convert an API response to a Pandas DataFrame, it is necessary to transform it first to a dictionary.
```python
import pandas as pd

response_dict = api_response.to_dict()['data']

simple_json_response = pd.DataFrame(response_dict)
nested_json_response = pd.json_normalize(response_dict)
```

### Debugging

The SDK uses the standard library [`logging`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#module-logging) module.

Setting `debug` to `True` on an instance of the `Configuration` class sets the log-level of related packages to `DEBUG`
and enables additional logging in Pythons [HTTP Client](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.client.html).

**Note**: This prints out sensitive information (e.g. the full request and response). Use with care.

```python
import logging
import fds.sdk.FactSetQuantFactorLibrary

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

configuration = fds.sdk.FactSetQuantFactorLibrary.Configuration(...)
configuration.debug = True
```

### Configure a Proxy

You can pass proxy settings to the Configuration class:

* `proxy`: The URL of the proxy to use.
* `proxy_headers`: a dictionary to pass additional headers to the proxy (e.g. `Proxy-Authorization`).

```python
import fds.sdk.FactSetQuantFactorLibrary

configuration = fds.sdk.FactSetQuantFactorLibrary.Configuration(
    # ...
    proxy="http://secret:password@localhost:5050",
    proxy_headers={
        "Custom-Proxy-Header": "Custom-Proxy-Header-Value"
    }
)
```

### Custom SSL Certificate

TLS/SSL certificate verification can be configured with the following Configuration parameters:

* `ssl_ca_cert`: a path to the certificate to use for verification in `PEM` format.
* `verify_ssl`: setting this to `False` disables the verification of certificates.
  Disabling the verification is not recommended, but it might be useful during
  local development or testing.

```python
import fds.sdk.FactSetQuantFactorLibrary

configuration = fds.sdk.FactSetQuantFactorLibrary.Configuration(
    # ...
    ssl_ca_cert='/path/to/ca.pem'
)
```

### Request Retries

In case the request retry behaviour should be customized, it is possible to pass a `urllib3.Retry` object to the `retry` property of the Configuration.

```python
from urllib3 import Retry
import fds.sdk.FactSetQuantFactorLibrary

configuration = fds.sdk.FactSetQuantFactorLibrary.Configuration(
    # ...
)

configuration.retries = Retry(total=3, status_forcelist=[500, 502, 503, 504])
```

## Notes for Large OpenAPI documents
If the OpenAPI document is large, imports in fds.sdk.FactSetQuantFactorLibrary.apis and fds.sdk.FactSetQuantFactorLibrary.models may fail with a
RecursionError indicating the maximum recursion limit has been exceeded. In that case, there are a couple of solutions:

Solution 1:
Use specific imports for apis and models like:
- `from fds.sdk.FactSetQuantFactorLibrary.api.default_api import DefaultApi`
- `from fds.sdk.FactSetQuantFactorLibrary.model.pet import Pet`

Solution 2:
Before importing the package, adjust the maximum recursion limit as shown below:
```
import sys
sys.setrecursionlimit(1500)
import fds.sdk.FactSetQuantFactorLibrary
from fds.sdk.FactSetQuantFactorLibrary.apis import *
from fds.sdk.FactSetQuantFactorLibrary.models import *
```

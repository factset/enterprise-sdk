The weighted average methods indicate 'weights' and 'weighting'. 'WeightedAverage' weights each group's members' statistic values and takes their average. 'WeightedNormalizedAverage' normalizes the corresponding weights belonging within each group, weights each group's members' statistic values, then takes the average. 'WeightedNormalizedAverageFill' normalizes the corresponding weights belonging within each group or applies equal weighting for groups with zero net weight, weights each group's members' statistic values, then takes the average. 'StatSpecific' indicates unique calculations for the supported security group levels (inquire for more information).
            sqrt (bool): Indicates whether the square root of each security group's value is taken (or not) as the final step of the calculation after the indicated algorithm to produce the result.

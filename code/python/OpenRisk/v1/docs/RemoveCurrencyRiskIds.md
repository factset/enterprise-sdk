# RemoveCurrencyRiskIds

Security IDs from which the contribution of currency to risk should be removed or not. Typical use includes asset types such as Contract for Difference (CFD), equity futures, and index futures. This will override the automatic currency removal based on assetTypes when provided. If this input type is provided, all assets that do not have explicit specification will have currency risk, because the default value is false.

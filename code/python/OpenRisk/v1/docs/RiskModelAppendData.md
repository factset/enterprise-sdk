# RiskModelAppendData

**(since 1.17.0)** Inline append data. This field can be used mainly for two purpose: 1) to supplement the risk model coverage when assets are not natively covered by a model, and 2) to intentionally override asset exposures and/or specific risk whenever there is misaligned view of an asset's risk profile between a model and a user.

## Properties

    Conversational API Powered by FactSet Mercury

    ### OVERVIEW  The FactSet Conversational API allows clients to white-label core FactSet Mercury capabilities in a clientâ€™s chatbot experience.  Request data from FactSet using natural language queries. Start the response generation using the `/query` endpoint, poll the status using `/status`. Once the result is ready, retrieve it using `/result`.  If your response contains a file ID, such as for an Excel chart or a FactSet ActiveGraph, retrieve it using the file ID at the `/download/file` endpoint.  We also encourage you to provide feedback on your responses using the `/feedback` endpoint!  **Please note:** \"Natural language\" in this documentation refers to modern conversational English. Support for other languages is currently unavailable.  **Try the Conversational API and view Available Content**  In the [Using the Conversational API Online Assistant](https://my.apps.factset.com/oa/pages/23209) you can find instructions on how to start using the Conversational API, and the full list of content available.  Some of the prompts supported are:  - What is Tesla's enterprise value? - Create a chart showing CME price relative to the S&P 500 - What were the highlights from Palantir's recent earnings call?  **Adaptive Card Format**  The Conversational API uses the Microsoft Adaptive Card format for response data surfaced from FactSet content sets. `Value` property of parent FederationData contains a JSON serialized presentation of a Microsoft Adaptive Card. See [Microsoft docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/adaptive-cards/) for Adaptive Card documentation, and the [Adaptive Card schema explorer](https://adaptivecards.io/explorer/) for schema details. **Please note**: \"The adaptive card may contain actions, which represent functionality within the card itself. In order to execute these actions, a handler must be implemented in your Adaptive Card rendering process. See [handling actions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/adaptive-cards/sdk/rendering-cards/javascript/actions) for an example implementation.  **STACH Format**  The Conversational API may use Factset's STACH V3 format to represent tabular data in JSON. Please refer to the [STACH V3 documentation](https://factset.github.io/stachschema/#/v3/README) on column organized data for more information on how to process STACH-organized data. <details>   <summary><u>**STACH Example**</u></summary>   ```json   {     \"version\": \"3.1\",     \"table\": {       \"primaryKeys\": [         \"Insider Holders\",         \"MV (M,$)\",         \"% O/S\"       ],       \"totalNumRows\": 5     },     \"views\": [       {         \"name\": \"view\",         \"displayName\": \"who are the suppliers of nike\",         \"table\": {           \"columns\": [             \"Insider Holders\",             \"MV (M,$)\",             \"% O/S\"           ],           \"headers\": {             \"Insider Holders\": \"Insider Holders\",             \"MV (M,$)\": \"MV (M,$)\",             \"% O/S\": \"% O/S\"           }         }       }     ],     \"columns\": [       {         \"name\": \"Insider Holders\",         \"contextualType\": \"string\",         \"customMetadata\": {           \"relevancy\": {             \"contextualType\": \"int32\",             \"value\": 100           }         }       },       {         \"name\": \"MV (M,$)\",         \"contextualType\": \"real\",         \"customMetadata\": {           \"relevancy\": {             \"contextualType\": \"int32\",             \"value\": 67           }         }       },       {         \"name\": \"% O/S\",         \"contextualType\": \"real\",         \"customMetadata\": {           \"relevancy\": {             \"contextualType\": \"int32\",             \"value\": 34           }         }       }     ],     \"rows\": [       {         \"Insider Holders\": \"Knight Philip Hampson\",         \"MV (M,$)\": 3156.8,         \"% O/S\": 1.531       },       {         \"Insider Holders\": \"Knight Travis A\",         \"MV (M,$)\": 601.6,         \"% O/S\": 0.496       },       {         \"Insider Holders\": \"Wellcome Trust Ltd.

Phrases within the response text are mapped to a data item in the `citations` object via a bracketed ID (e.g. `[1]`). Citations may be used to provide additional context or to verify the source of the data; in some cases, a single phrase within the response may be supported by multiple data sources. **Please note**: Links to the source data are provided as links to FactSet's Document Viewer (see [Document Viewer OA page](https://my.apps.factset.com/oa/pages/17390)). The link will direct you to the entire document; you may need to search for the specific phrase within the document.

# FactSet.SDK.RealTimeTimeSeries.Model.PostPricesTimeSeriesEodSubsampleGetRequestDataInterval
Non-empty interval of days specifying a single subsample period. The starting point `start` of the single subsample is usually the attribute `range.end` of a previously received `/prices/timeSeries/eod/subsample/list` request. A valid range is between 1900-01-01 and a day that is less than or equal to the maximum allowed day determined from the delay period (if any). The ending point `end` may exceed the maximally entitled date range.

 * Global Filings API
 *
 *  The Filings API provides a comprehensive set of functionalities for searching and retrieving filing documents from various sources.  This API is designed to expose document search and document retrieval functionality. A document search will allow a request to query FactSet document databases based on certain search criteria specified in the request.  In addition, a document count request will provide information on the number of stories available for a particular security.  The reference endpoints, such as sources, formTypes, timeZones, and categories, provide comprehensive lists of available sources, form types, time zones, and categories, respectively.

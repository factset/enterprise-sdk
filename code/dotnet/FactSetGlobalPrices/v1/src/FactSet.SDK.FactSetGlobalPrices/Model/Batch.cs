    /// Enables asynchronous \&quot;batch\&quot; processing for long-running requests, supporting durations up to 20 minutes. When batch&#x3D;Y is specified, the service responds with HTTP Status Code 202 (Accepted) indicating that the request has been received and is being processed. Use the batch status endpoint to check job progress, and retrieve results using the batch-result endpoint once processing is complete. Request Limits:   - Non-batch (real-time) requests:       * Single day: up to 500 IDs per request       * Multi-day: up to 50 IDs per request    - Batch requests:       * Single day: up to 2000 IDs per request       * Multi-day: up to 50 IDs per request  When using batch mode, the number of unique currencies present in the requested IDs is limited to 50 per request. It is recommended to use the POST method for large ID lists, as GET requests are still subject to URL query string length limits.

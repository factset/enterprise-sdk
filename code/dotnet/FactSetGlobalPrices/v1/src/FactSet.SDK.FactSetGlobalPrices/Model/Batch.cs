Upon requesting batch&#x3D;Y, the service will respond back with an HTTP Status Code of 202. Once a batch request is submitted, use batch status to see if the job has been completed. Once completed, retrieve the results of the request via batch-result. When using Batch, ids limit is increased to 10000 ids per request, though limits on query string via GET method still apply. It&#39;s advised to submit large lists of ids via POST method. Please note that the number of unique currencies present in the requested ids is limited to 50 per request.

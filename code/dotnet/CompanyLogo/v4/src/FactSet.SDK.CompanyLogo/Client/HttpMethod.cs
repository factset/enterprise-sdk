/*
 * Company Logo API
 *
 * Consume FactSet collected Company Logos through an API that seamlessly integrates with company fundamentals and estimates data (listed equities data available via the stocks API), quotes, time series, and other Digital APIs.  The logo API provides access to logos for a global universe of listed companies. The logos could be accessed by using national and international identifiers like ISIN, CUSIP, WKN, Valor, etc. and are a nice feature for comprehensive visualizations of equities on overview pages (factsheets).  Logo collection and maintenance takes into account IPOs, M&A notifications, and further consistency check mechanisms.  The Company Logo API seamlessly integrates with the [Stocks API](https://developer.factset.com/api-catalog/stocks-api-digital-portals) for equities and estimates data and the [Quotes API](https://developer.factset.com/api-catalog/real-time-quotes-api), allowing access to detailed price and performance information of listings. The [Quotes API](https://developer.factset.com/api-catalog/real-time-quotes-api) also supports basic security identifier cross-reference (see for example /notation/crossReference/getByFactSetMarketSymbol to retrieve an instrument id). For direct access to price histories for charting, please refer to the [Real-Time Time Series API](https://developer.factset.com/api-catalog/real-time-time-series-api).

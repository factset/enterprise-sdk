Common metrics include Average Dollars Traded, Share Turnover, and Bid Ask Spread.| |Market Sensitivity|Clarify the common variations in stock returns attributable to the performance of their local market indices. Leverage regressions performed between security-level and market-index returns across different return horizons and methodologies. Metrics are derived from FactSet Prices and include Beta R-Squared, Up Market Beta, and Down Market Beta.| |Momentum|Analyze the historical momentum of a security and uncover how each underlying data item, calculation, and horizon can be meaningful in different situations. Metrics are derived from FactSet Prices and include 52W Position, Return Momentum, and Velocity.| |Technical|Forecast the direction of future price movements based on historical market data and leverage heuristic or pattern-based signals from FactSet Prices. Common metrics include Average True Range, Ulcer Performance Index, and Money Flow Volume.| |Volatility|Measure the uncertainty in asset price movements with indicators from the FactSet Prices database. Capture various forms of uncertainty by employing statistical calculations on security performance data. Common metrics include Return Volatility, Semivariance, and Turbulence.| ### Core Fundamentals |Group|Descriptions| |- --|- --| |Efficiency|Leverage core financial data to determine how effectively a company uses its assets, collects payments, and operates its business. Most variables are measured as turnover ratios and include changes over time to provide transparency into the efficiency of each business process. Metrics are derived from FactSet Fundamentals and FactSet Estimates and include Asset Turnover, Receivables Turnover, and Cash Conversion Cycle| |Growth|Measure a company’s ability to grow faster than its peers. Compare the future expected growth of a company with its historical growth and view growth rates adjusted for stability. Integrate variables from FactSet RBICS, FactSet Fundamentals, and FactSet Estimates to analyze growth rates over multiple horizons including Market Share, Sales, and EPS Growth| |Management|Gain insight into how management finances their business and the decisions they make that impact the core financial statements.

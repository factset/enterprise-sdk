 * FactSet's Fund Ownership API gives access to both **Holdings** and **Holders** data.<p> Factset's Holdings endpoints gives access to all the underlying securities and their position detils held within a given fund. Fund Types supported include Open-End Mutual Funds, Closed-end Mutual Funds, and Exchange Traded Funds. Security Holders information retrieves all \"holder types\" and their positions across institutions, funds, insiders, and stakeholders.</p><p>The FactSet Ownership and Mutual Funds database collects global equity ownership data for approximately 50,000 institutions, 60,000 unique Mutual Fund portfolios, and 400,000 Insider/Stake holders from around 110 countries.

/*
 * FactSet Ownership API
 *
 * FactSet's Fund Ownership API gives access to both **Holdings**, **Holders**, and **Transactions** data.<p> Factset's Holdings endpoints gives access to all the underlying securities and their position details held within a given fund. Fund Types supported include Open-End Mutual Funds, Closed-end Mutual Funds, and Exchange Traded Funds. Security Holders information retrieves all \"holder types\" and their positions across institutions, funds, insiders, and stakeholders. FactSet also provides extensive insider and institutional transactions data for multiple countries including the United States, China, and Canada.</p><p>The FactSet Ownership and Mutual Funds database collects global equity ownership data for approximately 50,000 institutions, 60,000 unique Mutual Fund portfolios, and 400,000 Insider/Stakeholders from around 110 countries. For more details review our [Data Collection](https://my.apps.factset.com/oa/cms/oaAttachment/87e162be-f2d1-4f40-a85b-bfb1b020d270/20079) methodology. </p>

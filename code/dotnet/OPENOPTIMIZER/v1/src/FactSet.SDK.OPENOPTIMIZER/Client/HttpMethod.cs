/*
 * Open:Optimizer API
 *
 * The Open:Optimizer API provides the ability to trigger portfolio optimizations using any of the optimizers available on FactSet, including the FactSet Portfolio Optimizer, Axioma Portfolio Optimizer (equity or fixed income), Barra Portfolio Manager, and Northfield Portfolio Optimizer. Endpoints are available to initiate optimizations and view results, as well as retrieve document names and related metadata. API access is available with a subscription to an optimizer application. This API is intended to complement, not replace, the optimizer applications on FactSet. All strategies must still be created using the corresponding GUI applications on FactSet Workstation.

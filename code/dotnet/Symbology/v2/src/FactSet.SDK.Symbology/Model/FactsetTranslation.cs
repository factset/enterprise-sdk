This category also includes Italian savings shares.| |RIGHT|Right- A right gives the holder an option to purchase additional shares of an underlying instrument at a pre-determined price on a specified date (typically at a discount from the market price). In most cases, right instruments must be exercised within a relatively short period.| |SHARE|Share/Common/Ordinary- Securities that represent an ownership interest in a corporation. If the company has also issued preferred stock, both common and preferred stockholders have ownership rights. Common stockholders assume the greater risk, but generally exercise greater control and may gain a larger award in the form of dividends and capital appreciation.| |STRUCT|Structured Products- Investment products that are based on an underlying security such as a single equity, a basket of stocks, an index, a commodity, a debt issuance, or a foreign currency.| |TEMP|Temporary- Securities that trade for a limited period of time (typically less than a year) and trade alongside the mainline security. Also included are securities that trade alongside the mainline and then assimilate to the mainline security after trading for few days/months. Examples of temporary instruments are parallel lines and assented lines.| |UNIT|Unit- An equity that consists of more than one equity instrument (i.e., security consisting of class A and B; 1 share and 1 warrant).| |WARRANT|Warrant- An instrument giving the holder a right to subscribe to an underlying instrument at a given price and date.| </value>

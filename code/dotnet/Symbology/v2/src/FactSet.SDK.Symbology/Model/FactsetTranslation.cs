These securities are most commonly issued in Brazil, Canada, and many European markets (i.e., Russia, Germany, and Italy). Preferred equity has some priority rights over common stock. This category also includes Italian savings shares.| |RIGHT|Right- A right gives the holder an option to purchase additional shares of an underlying instrument at a pre-determined price on a specified date (typically at a discount from the market price). In most cases, right instruments must be exercised within a relatively short period.| |SHARE|Share/Common/Ordinary- Securities that represent an ownership interest in a corporation. If the company has also issued preferred stock, both common and preferred stockholders have ownership rights. Common stockholders assume the greater risk, but generally exercise greater control and may gain a larger award in the form of dividends and capital appreciation.| |STRUCT|Structured Products- Investment products that are based on an underlying security such as a single equity, a basket of stocks, an index, a commodity, a debt issuance, or a foreign currency.| |TEMP|Temporary- Securities that trade for a limited period of time (typically less than a year) and trade alongside the mainline security. Also included are securities that trade alongside the mainline and then assimilate to the mainline security after trading for few days/months. Examples of temporary instruments are parallel lines and assented lines.| |UNIT|Unit- An equity that consists of more than one equity instrument (i.e., security consisting of class A and B; 1 share and 1 warrant).| |WARRANT|Warrant- An instrument giving the holder a right to subscribe to an underlying instrument at a given price and date.| </value>

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**InformationRatio** | **decimal** | This ratio expresses the level of active return (i.e., portfolio return in excess of the benchmark) per unit of risk within the active return (i.e., standard deviation of the active returns: see tracking error). The information ratio is a common proxy for inferring manager skill in that it provides insight into the consistency of active return. | [optional] 
**SharpeRatio** | **decimal** | The Sharpe ratio is a measure of excess return, per unit of total risk. It provides insight into the price being paid (portfolio return in excess of the risk free rate) per unit of risk being taken (standard deviation of portfolio returns). | [optional] 
**TreynorRatio** | **decimal** | This metric measures excess return per unit of systematic risk. It provides insight into the price being paid (portfolio return in excess of the risk free rate) per unit of systematic risk being taken (portfolio beta). | [optional]

# **GetFdsFundamentalsMetrics**
> MetricsResponse GetFdsFundamentalsMetrics (string category = null, string subcategory = null, string metricDataType = null, bool? pitDataItems = null)

Returns available FactSet Fundamental metrics and ratios.

Returns list of available FF_* metrics that can be used in the `metrics` parameter of related endpoints. These are related to FactSet Fundamentals standardized data. As Reported will be available in future endpoints. Leave Category and Subcategory blank to request all available items. The Endpoint Data model is optimized for time-series data with periodicity. Some items in this list are non-time series. **For methodology definitions, reference the `OApageID` or `OAurl` response items to launch the available methodology page.**

### Example Code

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using FactSet.SDK.Utils.Authentication;
using FactSet.SDK.FactSetSupplyChain.Api;
using FactSet.SDK.FactSetSupplyChain.Client;
using FactSet.SDK.FactSetSupplyChain.Model;

namespace Example
{
    public static class GetRelationshipsExample
    {
        public static async Task Main()
        {
            var config = new FactSet.SDK.FactSetSupplyChain.Client.Configuration();

            // Examples for each supported authentication method are below,
            // choose one that satisfies your use case.

            /* (Preferred) OAuth 2.0: FactSetOAuth2 */
            // See https://github.com/FactSet/enterprise-sdk#oauth-20
            // for information on how to create the app-config.json file
            //
            // The confidential client instance should be reused in production environments.
            // See https://github.com/FactSet/enterprise-sdk-utils-dotnet#authentication
            // for more information on using the ConfidentialClient class
            ConfidentialClient confidentialClient = await ConfidentialClient.CreateAsync("/path/to/app-config.json");
            config.OAuth2Client = confidentialClient;

            /* Basic authentication: FactSetApiKey */
            // See https://github.com/FactSet/enterprise-sdk#api-key
            // for information how to create an API key
            // config.Username = "USERNAME-SERIAL";
            // config.Password = "API-KEY";

            var apiInstance = new RelationshipsApi(config);
            var ids = new List<string>(); // List<string> | The requested list of security identifiers. Accepted ID types include Market Tickers, SEDOL, ISINs, CUSIPs, or FactSet Permanent Ids. * Make Note - id limit of 500 
            var relationshipType = "COMPETITORS";  // string |  The category describing how the source company is connected to another organization. Use this parameter to filter results based on the business relationship type. Defined as:    * **SUPPLIERS** = An organization that provides goods or services to the source company. The source company acts as the buyer in this relationship. (inverse of \"Customer\" relationships.)   * **COMPETITORS** = An organization explicitly identified by the source company as a rival, usually operating in the same market or industry sector.   * **CUSTOMERS** = An organization that receives goods or services from the source company. The source company acts as the seller in this relationship. (Reverse of \"Supplier\" relationships.)   * **PARTNERS** = An organization in which the source company holds an ownership interest (i.e., the source company owns shares or equity in the partner). This is the counterpart to an investor relationship, where the external party has an ownership interest in the source company.  (default to SUPPLIERS)
            var companyType = "PUBLIC_COMPANIES_ONLY";  // string | Specifies the category of companies to include when filtering results:   * **PUBLIC_COMPANIES_ONLY**: Include only relationships involving companies that are publicly traded.            * **PRIVATE_COMPANIES_ONLY**: Include only relationships involving companies that are privately held (not publicly traded).            * **ALL**: Include relationships involving both public and private companies.  (optional)  (default to PUBLIC_COMPANIES_ONLY)
            var relationshipDirection = "ALL";  // string | Filters the list of available relationship directions -   * **ALL** = Include both direct and reverse relationships.   * **DIRECT** = Include only relationships where the source company identified and named the connection to the target company.   * **REVERSE** = Include only relationships where the target company identified and named the connection to the source company.  (optional)  (default to ALL)

            try
            {
                // Returns Supply Chain Relationships Data.
                RelationshipsResponse result = apiInstance.GetRelationships(ids, relationshipType, companyType, relationshipDirection);
                Console.WriteLine(result.ToJson());
            }
            catch (ApiException e)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Exception when calling RelationshipsApi.GetRelationships: " + e.Message );
                Console.WriteLine("Status Code: "+ e.ErrorCode);
                Console.WriteLine(e.StackTrace);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Using a Proxy

To use the API client with a HTTP proxy, setup a `System.Net.WebProxy`

```csharp
Configuration c = new Configuration();
System.Net.WebProxy webProxy = new System.Net.WebProxy("http://myProxyUrl:80/");
webProxy.Credentials = System.Net.CredentialCache.DefaultCredentials;
c.Proxy = webProxy;
```

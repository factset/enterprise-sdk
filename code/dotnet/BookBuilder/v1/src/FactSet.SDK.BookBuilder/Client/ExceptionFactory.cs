 * BookBuilder
 *
 * The BookBuilder API is a powerful tool that combines detailed reports for companies of interest. Save time by using a single source of knowledge instead of relying on multiple APIs to create a presentation ready PDF, also known as a Public Information Book(PIB). </br></br> Consistently create books with the same content/reports for different companies by defining templates with the set of reports saved for re-use. Or, use templates that are created by FactSet for quick use. </br></br> With our powerful API endpoints, you can get the information on companies of interest quickly where and when you need it. </br></br>

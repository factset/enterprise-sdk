# FactSet.SDK.FactSetEstimates.Model.ActualsRequest
Request object for requesting actual estimates.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**Ids** | **List&lt;string&gt;** | The requested list of security identifiers. Accepted ID types include Market Tickers, SEDOL, ISINs, CUSIPs, or FactSet Permanent Ids. * Make Note - id limit of 3000 for defaults, otherwise the service is limited to a 30 second duration. This can be reached when increasing total number of metrics requested and depth of history. *  | 
**Metrics** | **List&lt;string&gt;** | Requested metrics. Use the &#x60;/metrics&#x60; endpoint for a list of estimate items. Note, the number of metrics you are allowed to supply is limited to 1 for now. For more details, visit [Online Assistant Page #15034](https://oa.apps.factset.com/pages/15034). | 
**RelativeFiscalStart** | **int** | Relative fiscal period, expressed as an integer, used to filter results. This is combined with the periodicity parameter to specify a relative estimate period. FactSet Estimates Actuals provides data for past periods. Therefore, the input for &#x60;relativeFiscalStart&#x60; must be an integer that is zero or less. For example, set to 0 and periodicity to ANN to ask for the current reported year (FY0). | [optional] 
**RelativeFiscalEnd** | **int** | Relative fiscal period, expressed as an integer, used to filter results. This is combined with the periodicity parameter to specify a relative estimate period.Therefore, the input for &#x60;relativeFiscalEnd&#x60; must be an integer that is zero or less. For example, set to -2 and periodicity to ANN to ask for two fiscal years before the latest (FY-2). | [optional] 
**Periodicity** | [**Periodicity**](Periodicity.md) |  | [optional] 
**Currency** | **string** | Currency code for adjusting the data. Use input as &#39;ESTIMATE&#39; for values in Estimate currency. For a list of currency ISO codes, visit [Online Assistant Page #1470](https://oa.apps.factset.com/pages/1470). | [optional]

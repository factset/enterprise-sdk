/*
 * Investment Research API
 *
 *  The Investment Research API provides a comprehensive set of functionalities for searching and retrieving research reports and documents from various contributors.  This API is designed to expose document search and document retrieval functionality. A document search will allow a request to query FactSet document databases based on certain search criteria specified in the request.  FactSet collects research reports and models from brokers, independent research providers, market research firms, rating agencies, and other publishers of research. These documents are processed and made available to clients within about two minutes of receipt.  FactSet delivers this content through two main products:  **FactSet Research Connect** – real-time research for investment managers entitled by the contributors to access the content.  **FactSet Aftermarket Research** – delayed research for investment bankers permitted by contributors to purchase the research.  The meta endpoints namely time-zones, categories, research-contributors, research-analysts, security-types and asset-types provide comprehensive lists of data that is used in the research endpoints.

 * FactSet RIBCS
 * FactSet Revere Business Industry Classification System (RBICS) is a comprehensive structured taxonomy to classify companies by what they primarily do. It delivers a granular view for investors by classifying companies using a bottom-up approach according to the products and services they provide. By combining this approach with a top-level grouping based on companies' behavior similarities and stock co-movement, FactSet RBICS delivers unprecedented precision for 1,400+ sector groups.  RBICS Focus is a six level classification which highlights the companys main business. It is based on the company business line/s that stand for majority of a the revenue that the company generates. Updated monthly. For more details, visit [Online Assitant Page #20710](https://oa.apps.factset.com/pages/20710).

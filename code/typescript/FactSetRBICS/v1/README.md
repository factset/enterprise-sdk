FactSet Revere Business Industry Classification System (RBICS) is a comprehensive structured taxonomy to classify companies by what they primarily do. It delivers a granular view for investors by classifying companies using a bottom-up approach according to the products and services they provide. By combining this approach with a top-level grouping based on companies' behavior similarities and stock co-movement, FactSet RBICS delivers unprecedented precision for 1,400+ sector groups.

RBICS Focus is a six level classification which highlights the companys main business. It is based on the company business line/s that stand for majority of a the revenue that the company generates. Updated monthly. For more details, visit [Online Assitant Page #20710](https://oa.apps.factset.com/pages/20710).

```

## Usage

1. [Generate authentication credentials](../../../../README.md#authentication).
2. Setup Node.js environment
   1. Install and activate Node.js >=14. If you're using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm):

      ```sh
      nvm install 16
      nvm use 16
      ```

   2. (optional) [Install yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install).
3. [Install dependencies](#installation).
4. Run the following:


```javascript
const { ApiClient, EntityFocusApi } = require('@factset/sdk-factsetrbics');
const { ConfidentialClient } = require('@factset/sdk-utils');

const apiClient = ApiClient.instance;

// Examples for each supported authentication method are below,
// choose one that satisfies your use case.

// (Preferred) OAuth 2.0: FactSetOAuth2
// See https://github.com/FactSet/enterprise-sdk#oauth-20
// for information on how to create the app-config.json file
// See https://github.com/FactSet/enterprise-sdk-utils-typescript#authentication
// for more information on using the ConfidentialClient class
apiClient.factsetOauth2Client = new ConfidentialClient('/path/to/app-config.json');

// Basic authentication: FactSetApiKey
// See https://github.com/FactSet/enterprise-sdk#api-key
// for information how to create an API key
// const FactSetApiKey = apiClient.authentications['FactSetApiKey'];
// FactSetApiKey.username = 'USERNAME-SERIAL';
// FactSetApiKey.password = 'API-KEY';

const apiInstance = new EntityFocusApi();
const ids = ["AAPL-US","0FPWZZ-E","TSLA-US"]; // [String] | List of Company identifiers. Accepted identifiers include Ticker-Exchange, Ticker-Regions, CUSIPs, ISINs, SEDOLs, or FactSet Permanent Ids, such as -R, -L, or -E.<p>**ids limit = 2500 per request**</p>    Make note, GET Method URL request lines are also limited to a total length of 8192 bytes (8KB). In cases where the service allows for thousands of ids, which may lead to exceeding this request line limit of 8KB, its advised for any requests with large request lines to be requested through the respective \"POST\" method.</p> 
const opts = {
  'date': 2017-07-24, // String | Effective date for data expressed in YYYY-MM-DD format. If no date is requested, the default behavior is to return the full history for the requested entity.
  'levels': [1,3,6], // [Number] | List of RBICS industry levels to include in the response. **By default if left blank, all levels are returned.**
  'includeNames': true // Boolean | Option to include or exclude industry Names and the L6 Description. true = Include Names; false = Exclude Names.
};

// Call api endpoint
apiInstance.getRbicsEntityFocus(ids, opts).then(
  data => {

    console.log('API called successfully. Returned data:');
    console.log(data);
  },
  error => {
    console.error(error);
  },
);

```

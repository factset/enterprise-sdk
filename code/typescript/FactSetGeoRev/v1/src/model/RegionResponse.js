/**
 * FactSet GeoRev API
 * FactSet Revere Geographic Revenue (\"GeoRev\") Exposure data provides a highly structured and normalized display of companies’ revenues by geography. Using a four level taxonomy structure, understand the companies' Super-Region-->Region-->Area-->Country revenue breakdowns. Quickly understand a company’s revenue exposure in countries impacted by geopolitical, macroeconomic, and market risk. Understand the geographic footprint of a company based on sources of revenue versus country of domicile, and analyze global revenue exposures at the company, index, or portfolio level.<p> Geographic revenue has historically been difficult to analyze due to companies’ non-standard and incomplete reporting. Investors relying solely on this as-reported data are limited in their ability to compare, aggregate or screen exposures across a universe or portfolio of companies. To achieve normalization, FactSet GeoRev captures data through a proprietary four-level geographic classification structure. An estimation algorithm based on GDP weighting and accounting logic is then applied to solve for any non-explicit disclosures. The result is a consistent, accurate, and flexible dataset that can take a company’s revenues and break them down into any geographic country or region categories.</p><p>As markets become more integrated and companies expand operations beyond their domestic markets, GeoRev provides a new and valuable country factor to help investors discover alpha, model risk exposure, optimize portfolio weighting, and improve fund administration and reporting.</p><p>Data Frequency -  Annual; Update Frequency - Daily. 49,000+ Publically Listed Companies. All Russell 3000 and MSCI ACWI Index Consituents. U.S. Data is available from 2003, with Non-US data from 2007. For more details, visit [OA 17555](https://my.apps.factset.com/oa/pages/17555)</p>

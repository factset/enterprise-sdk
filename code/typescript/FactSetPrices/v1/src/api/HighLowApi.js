     * @param {Object} opts Optional parameters
     * @param {String} opts.date The as of date in **YYYY-MM-DD** format. This controls the perspective date in which the period parameter will be computed. If left blank, the API will default to previous close. Future dates (T+1) are not accepted in this endpoint. 
     * @param {module:model/String} opts.period The period of measure for the security's high and low pricing. This does not change display `frequency` but rather the underlying period. For example, if you wish to fetch the latest 52 week high and low price, select 52W. All periods are referencing actual periods of measure, not period-ends where-    * **D** = Daily   * **W** = Weekly, based on the last trading day of the week. Use the 52W for representing the latest year.   * **M** = Monthly, based on the start date (e.g., if the start date is June 16, data is displayed for June 16, May 16, April 16 etc.).   * **YTD** = Year-to-Date   * **Y** =  Actual Annual, based on the start date.  (default to '52W')
     * @param {module:model/String} opts.priceType Controls whether price high and low data is returned intraday or at the close. For example, by selecting INTRADAY, if a security price reached an all time high of 10 during trading hours over the period of measure but closed that day at 8, then the service will return 10. If CLOSE was selected the service would return 8 if that was the high for the period measured.  (default to 'CLOSE')
     * @param {module:model/String} opts.calendar Calendar of data returned. SEVENDAY includes weekends. LOCAL calendar will default to the securities' trading calendar which excludes date records for respective holiday periods. (default to 'FIVEDAY')
     * @param {String} opts.currency Currency code for adjusting prices. Default is Local. For a list of currency ISO codes, visit [Online Assistant Page 1470](https://oa.apps.factset.com/pages/1470).
     * @param {module:model/String} opts.adjust Controls the split, spinoff, and dividend adjustments for the prices. <p>For more information, visit [Online Assistant Page 614](https://oa.apps.factset.com/pages/614)</p>   * **SPLIT** = Split ONLY Adjusted.

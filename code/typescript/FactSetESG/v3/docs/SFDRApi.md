Requests Principle Adverse Impact (PAI) data to support compliant SFDR Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) reporting

SFDR Principle Adverse Impact (PAI) data is built specifically to support compliant Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) reporting. FactSet collects PAI data items from publicly available company-reported information and FactSet databases, such as FactSet Fundamentals, FactSet RBICS with Revenue and FactSet People, which are also based on company-disclosures. FactSet uses Truvalue Labs SASB Spotlights for supplemental OECD &amp; UNGC violation checks where company reporting is sparse.  

### Example

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The parameter variables defined below are just examples and may potentially contain non valid values. Please replace them with valid values.

#### Example Code

```javascript
const { ApiClient, SFDRApi } = require('@factset/sdk-factsetesg');
const { ConfidentialClient } = require('@factset/sdk-utils');

const apiClient = ApiClient.instance;

// Examples for each supported authentication method are below,
// choose one that satisfies your use case.

// (Preferred) OAuth 2.0: FactSetOAuth2
// See https://github.com/FactSet/enterprise-sdk#oauth-20
// for information on how to create the app-config.json file
//
// The confidential client instance should be reused in production environments.
// See https://github.com/FactSet/enterprise-sdk-utils-typescript#authentication
// for more information on using the ConfidentialClient class
apiClient.factsetOauth2Client = new ConfidentialClient('/path/to/app-config.json');

// Basic authentication: FactSetApiKey
// See https://github.com/FactSet/enterprise-sdk#api-key
// for information how to create an API key

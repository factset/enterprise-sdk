Foreign Exchange Rates API in which retrieves Spots and Forwards for a given currency pair and date range. <p>*Spots and Forwards rates are sourced from W/M Reuters.The WM Company calculates daily standardized spot rates for global foreign exchange transactions, using rates provided by Reuters. These rates are recognized globally as the standard by banks, fund managers, and index compilers; increasingly these rates are also being used for benchmark currency trading. In 1994, WM Company began calculating closing spot rates. Closing spot rates provide a standard set of currency rates so that portfolio valuations can be compared to each other and their performances measured against benchmarks, without having discrepancies caused by exchange rates. Closing spot rates are recorded at 16:00 GMT.*</p>

```javascript
const { ApiClient, ForwardsApi } = require('@factset/sdk-foreignexchangerate');
const { ConfidentialClient } = require('@factset/sdk-utils');

const apiClient = ApiClient.instance;

// Examples for each supported authentication method are below,
// choose one that satisfies your use case.

// (Preferred) OAuth 2.0: FactSetOAuth2
// See https://github.com/FactSet/enterprise-sdk#oauth-20

apiClient.factsetOauth2Client = new ConfidentialClient('/path/to/app-config.json');

// Basic authentication: FactSetApiKey
// See https://github.com/FactSet/enterprise-sdk#api-key
// for information how to create an API key
// const FactSetApiKey = apiClient.authentications['FactSetApiKey'];
// FactSetApiKey.username = 'USERNAME-SERIAL';
// FactSetApiKey.password = 'API-KEY';

const apiInstance = new ForwardsApi();
const ids = ["USDGBP"]; // [String] | The currency pair requested in the format of a ISO {source}{target}. For a complete list of ISO currencies, please visit [OA 1470](https://my.apps.factset.com/oa/pages/1470)
const opts = {
  'forwardPeriod': ON, // String | Bid, offer, and mid rates are available for the following 11 time periods.  * ON - Overnight  * TN - Tomorrow Next  * SW - One Week (Spot Week)  * 1M - One Month  * 2M - Two Months  * 3M - Three Months  * 6M - Six Months  * 9M - Nine Months  * 1Y - One Year  * 2Y - Two Years  * 5Y - Five Years

  'endDate': 2019-12-31, // String | The end date requested for a given date range in **YYYY-MM-DD** format. If left blank, the API will default to latest available. 
  'frequency': D // String | Controls the display frequency of the data returned.   * **D** = Daily   * **W** = Weekly, based on the last day of the week of the start date.   * **M** = Monthly, based on the last trading day of the month.   * **AM** = Monthly, based on the start date (e.g., if the start date is June 16, data is displayed for June 16, May 16, April 16 etc.).    * **CQ** = Quarterly based on the last trading day of the calendar quarter (March, June, September, or December).   * **AY** = Actual Annual, based on the start date.   * **CY** = Calendar Annual, based on the last trading day of the calendar year. 
};

// Call api endpoint
apiInstance.getFXForwards(ids, opts).then(
  data => {
    console.log('API called successfully. Returned data:');
    console.log(data);
  },
  error => {
    console.error(error);

    Foreign Exchange Rates API in which retrieves Spots and Forwards for a given
    currency pair and date range. <p>*Spots and Forwards rates are sourced from
    W/M Reuters.The WM Company calculates daily standardized spot rates for
    global foreign exchange transactions, using rates provided by Reuters. These
    rates are recognized globally as the standard by banks, fund managers, and
    index compilers; increasingly these rates are also being used for benchmark
    currency trading. In 1994, WM Company began calculating closing spot rates.
    Closing spot rates provide a standard set of currency rates so that
    portfolio valuations can be compared to each other and their performances
    measured against benchmarks, without having discrepancies caused by exchange
    rates. Closing spot rates are recorded at 16:00 GMT.*</p>

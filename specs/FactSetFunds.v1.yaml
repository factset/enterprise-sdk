        on the fund's mandate.|

        |Focus|The 2nd of 3 asset-class-specific, hierarchical exposure tiers;
        the fund's classification within its category (e.g. Small Cap, Energy,
        Palladium, Long/Short); based on the fund's mandate.|

        |Niche|The 3rd of 3 asset-class-specific, hierarchical exposure tiers;
        The fund's classification within its Focus. Most granular tier of
        exposure sort (e.g., Growth, Coal, Physically held, Merger Arbitrage);
        based on the fund's mandate.|

        |Economic Development Level|The country development level of the fund
        (Developed, Emerging, Frontier, or Blended) based on the fund's

        Get the Fund Flows. One-day fund flows are calculated by subtracting the
        shares outstanding at previous close from the shares outstanding one day
        prior to close, and then multiplying the result by the net asset value
        (NAV) of one day prior to close.


        The fund flows calculation breaks down as follows - 

        (Shares Outstanding T0 - Shares Outstanding T-1) * NAV T-1

        While NAVs are routinely reported on a trade-day (T0) basis,
        industry-wide shares outstanding are a mixture of trade-day and next-day
        values. Trade-day values are not verified, as the actual
        creation/redemption activity takes place late in the evening, after NAVs
        and shares outstanding values have been published. The result is that
        multiple industry flows are calculated using unverified T0 values.

        FactSet has standardized all shares outstanding reporting on a next-day
        basis. To ensure that assets under management (AUM) and fund flows are
        synchronized, FactSet synchronizes shares outstanding values and changes
        with NAVs reported on the previous day, as the creations and redemptions
        used the previous day's reported NAVs as a transaction price. <p>For

            convertible into common stock, or securities or other instruments
            whose price is linked to the value of common stock. Fund management
            places particular emphasis on companies with below average

            may invest up to 25% of its total assets in the securities of

              The fund seeks capital appreciation and income from an actively
              managed portfolio of US large-cap value stocks.

              The fund provides narrow exposure to the US large-cap value
              segment. It actively manages a portfolio of 30 to 50 stocks issued
              by companies the adviser believes are undervalued relative to
              their intrinsic worth. The fund emphasizes firms with below
              average price-to-earnings ratios that may pay above average
              dividends. Eligible companies must also have a market
              capitalization within the range of companies included in the
              Russell 1000 Value Index, a market cap-weighted index of large-cap
              value firms. The portfolio includes common stock, preferred and
              convertible securities, other financial instruments that are
              components of, or have characteristics similar to the securities
              included in the Russell 1000 Value Index, as well as American
              Depositary Receipts (ADRs). Though the fund primarily holds US
              companies, it may invest up to 25% of its total assets in foreign
              issuers.

              Under normal circumstances, the Fund seeks to invest at least 80%
              of its net assets plus the amount of any borrowings for investment
              purposes in large cap equity securities and derivatives that have
              similar economic characteristics to such securities. For purposes
              of the Fund’s 80% policy, large cap equity securities are equity
              securities that at the time of purchase have a market
              capitalization within the range of companies included in the
              Russell 1000® Value Index (the “Russell 1000 Value Index”). The
              Russell 1000 Value Index is a capitalization-weighted index from a
              broad range of industries chosen for market size, liquidity and
              industry group representation. Equity securities consist of common
              stock, preferred stock and convertible securities, other financial
              instruments that are components of, or have characteristics
              similar to, the securities included in the Russell 1000 Value
              Index, and American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”), which are
              receipts typically issued by an American bank or trust company
              that evidence underlying securities issued by a foreign company.
              The Fund invests primarily in equity securities that Fund
              management believes are undervalued, which means that their prices
              are less than Fund management believes they are worth. Fund
              management places particular emphasis on companies with below
              average price/earnings ratios that may pay above average
              dividends. The Fund invests primarily in common stock of U.S.
              companies, but the Fund may invest up to 25% of its total assets
              in the securities of foreign companies and ADRs. The Fund
              generally intends to invest in not less than 30 to not more than
              50 companies.

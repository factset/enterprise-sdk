    With global coverage since 1999, the FactSet Estimates API provides you with
    comprehensive estimates and statistics on a wide variety of financial
    statement items as well as industry-specific metrics. The universe is
    comprised of over 19,000 active companies across 90+ countries with the
    following types of data included:
     
    - **Consensus**

    - **Detail**

    - **Ratings**

    - **Surprise**

    - **Segments**

    - **Actuals**

    - **Guidance**

    - **New Estimates and Ratings Reports Endpoints**


    For clients seeking  curated and relevant financial data, the FactSet
    Estimates API now includes Estimates and Ratings Reports endpoints. These
    powerful endpoints are designed for easy integration and consumption,
    delivering a wide array of financial metrics, estimates, and critical
    statistics in a highly accessible format suitable for both mobile and web
    applications.
     
    Whether you are an analyst, investor, or financial professional, the
    Estimates and Ratings Reports endpoints offer detailed and actionable
    financial insights that can support thorough analyses and strategic
    decision-making processes.

    companies, and corporate finance teams to:
     
    - **Elevate Client Engagement:** Enrich user experiences in client-facing
    applications with comprehensive and up-to-date financial metrics.

        Returns FactSet Estimates consensus data using rolling fiscal dates.
        <p>The rolling behavior causes fiscal year to automatically roll from
        one year to the next as the historical perspective date changes. The
        fiscal period rolls forward as of each period end. This endpoint is
        optimized to allow the request to simply include a relative fiscal
        period (e.g. use relativeFiscalStart integer 1 and periodicity ANN for
        next unreported fiscal year end), and then see what the consensus
        thought the "next fiscal year" estimates were through time as you "roll"
        back your perspective dates. This differs from locking down an absolute
        estimate period such as explicitly stating Fiscal Year 2019. This can be
        done in the fixed-consensus endpoint.</p>

            * Not Available- A broker may be "Not Available" due to outstanding
            circumstances with that particular security. Ratings are not
            displayed until a new rating is provided.

            * Most/Least- "Most" or "Least" favorable rating is displayed for

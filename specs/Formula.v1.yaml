    **FactSet Formula API**


    FactSet’s Formula API is a modern, flexible, formula-based API that enables
    users to access FactSet’s wide range of financial data and content. The API
    offers two endpoints, one optimized for time-series analysis and one
    designed for cross-sectional analysis, providing users a simplified
    interface into FactSet’s expansive offering. By providing two endpoints, it
    allows for the optimization of user workflows, while reducing complexity.


    Leverage the power and flexibility of the Formula API to -
      * Pull data from across most content sets that a user has access to in a single request
      * Include business logic and mathematical operations in request
      * Submit a dynamic universe in both endpoints
      * Return the fsymId to easily combine with other FactSet content / products
      * Set the trading calendar
      * Define custom display names

    **Formula API Request Builder**


    The Formula API Request Builder provides users everything they need to form
    a Formula API request. In the Request Builder, you can select identifiers,
    build a universe expression, select FQL or Screening formulas, easily apply
    business logic and mathematical functions to the FQL or Screening formulas,
    specify optional parameters, and construct a GET or POST request. The
    Request Builder eliminates the need to have previous FQL and Screening
    knowledge and allows you to quickly find your desired data items and form
    the request.


    The Formula API Request Builder can be accessed by navigating to
    [https://developer.factset.com/formula-api-request-builder](https://developer.factset.com/formula-api-request-builder)
    and logging in using your FactSet.net ID. When using the Request Builder to
    construct requests for the one of the Formula API's endpoints, be sure to
    toggle to the correct endpoint at the top of the page.


    **How to Check the Health and Availability of the Formula API**


    Please use the below endpoint to check the health and availability of the
    Formula API. You must be authorized for this API to use the Health endpoint.

    **How to Programmatically Download API Specification File**


    You can download the FactSet Formula API Specification File in .yaml. using
    the "Download Spec" button to the right of the version number. This
    specification can then be used for Codegen to create your own SDKs.

        The `/time-series` endpoint is closely aligned with FactSet’s powerful
        data retrieval language **FactSet Query Language (FQL)** which is
        optimized for time-series analysis. FQL can also perform sophisticated
        statistical, mathematical, logical, and other complex operations on the
        data.

          This endpoint has a unique **TIMESERIES** data object that pairs the requested data with FactSet provided dates. This helps reduce the need for additional data requests and reduces the work required by users.

        The `/time-series` endpoint supports Long Running asynchronous requests
        up to **20 minutes** via the `batch` parameter. *This feature is
        available to Individual Users subscribed to the Performance Package and
        Performance Package Plus Performance Tiers and all Production Users. If
        you are unsure which Performance Tier you are subscribed to or you would
        like to gain access to the batch capabilities, please contact your
        FactSet Account Team or "Report Issue" above and our support teams can
        assist.*

      description: >
        The `/cross-sectional` endpoint is closely aligned with FactSet’s
        powerful data retrieval **Screening language** which is optimized for
        analysis of data items at single point in time for different entities
        and is extremely efficient for large universes.



        The `/cross-sectional` endpoint supports Long Running asynchronous
        requests up to **10 minutes** via the `batch` parameter. *This feature
        is available to Individual Users subscribed to the Performance Package
        and Performance Package Plus Performance Tiers and all Production Users.
        If you are unsure which Performance Tier you are subscribed to or you
        would like to gain access to the batch capabilities, please contact your

        assist.*

        ### Iterated Cross-Sectional Functionality



        This endpoint supports the ability to automatically iterate through
        different cross sections over time. The **Iterated Cross-Sectional
        Functionality (ICSF)** expands the Cross-Sectional endpoint to support
        retrieving data items for *multiple dates*, allowing users to take
        advantage of the Screening engine’s efficiency even when history is
        required. 



        Use the parameters `startDate`, `endDate`, and `frequency` in the
        Cross-Sectional endpoint to provide your desired dates. Specify “0” in
        date argument of the Screening formulas provided in the formulas
        parameter and/or the universe parameter. Lastly, the Iterated
        Cross-Sectional Functionality is required to run as a `batch` request.
        Therefore, the batch parameter must be set to “Y”. 



        Access to backtesting and batch functionality is required to leverage
        the Iterated Cross-Sectional Functionality. 


        **When to use ICSF:**


        The ICSF can offer better performance than Time-Series requests when the
        date range is relatively small, and so it is recommended to use ICSF if
        the number of IDs requested is greater than the number of dates. If the
        number of dates is greater than the number of IDs in the request, it is
        recommended to use Time-Series.


        *Note: This is a general rule of thumb and performance may vary
        depending on the formulas in use.*

        The `/cross-sectional` endpoint is closely aligned with FactSet’s
        powerful data retrieval **Screening language** which is optimized for
        analysis of data items at single point in time for different entities
        and is extremely efficient for large universes.



        The `/cross-sectional` endpoint supports Long Running asynchronous
        requests up to **10 minutes** via the `batch` parameter. *This feature
        is available to Individual Users subscribed to the Performance Package
        and Performance Package Plus Performance Tiers and all Production Users.
        If you are unsure which Performance Tier you are subscribed to or you
        would like to gain access to the batch capabilities, please contact your
        FactSet Account Team or "Report Issue" above and our support teams can
        assist.*

        ### Iterated Cross-Sectional Functionality



        This endpoint supports the ability to automatically iterate through
        different cross sections over time. The **Iterated Cross-Sectional
        Functionality (ICSF)** expands the Cross-Sectional endpoint to support
        retrieving data items for *multiple dates*, allowing users to take
        advantage of the Screening engine’s efficiency even when history is
        required. 



        Use the parameters `startDate`, `endDate`, and `frequency` in the
        Cross-Sectional endpoint to provide your desired dates. Specify “0” in
        date argument of the Screening formulas provided in the formulas
        parameter and/or the universe parameter. Lastly, the Iterated
        Cross-Sectional Functionality is required to run as a `batch` request.
        Therefore, the batch parameter must be set to “Y”. 



        Access to backtesting and batch functionality is required to leverage
        the Iterated Cross-Sectional Functionality. 


        **When to use ICSF:**


        The ICSF can offer better performance than Time-Series requests when the
        date range is relatively small, and so it is recommended to use ICSF if
        the number of IDs requested is greater than the number of dates. If the
        number of dates is greater than the number of IDs in the request, it is
        recommended to use Time-Series. 


        *Note: This is a general rule of thumb and performance may vary
        depending on the formulas in use.*

        Available symbol types -

        * DEFAULT - Accepted symbol types include Market Tickers, SEDOLs, ISINs,
        CUSIPs, or FactSet Permanent Ids.


        * BLOOMBERG - Accepted symbol types include Bloomberg Tickers and
        Bloomberg FIGIs. 
          * When submitting Bloomberg symbols, the Bloomberg symbol is translated to a FactSet Permanent Identifier which is then used to retrieve the requested FQL and Screening formulas. The Bloomberg symbol submitted will be returned in the response in the field *requestId*. To see the FactSet Permanent Identifer that the Bloomberg symbol resolved to, use the `fsymId` parameter in addition to the `symbolType` parameter.
          * Bloomberg symbols can not be submitted with other symbol types. 
          * Bloomberg Symbol Resolution is not available via Batch Requests.

        Bloomberg Symbol Resolution is included with the Individual User
        subscription. Users with a Production User subscription require
        additional access to submit Bloomberg symbols. If you would like to gain
        access to Bloomberg Symbol Resolution, please contact your FactSet

            These data items showcase the ability to include logic, mathematical
            operations, and other functions in the request itself.


            The first data item using the division operator to calculate a P/E
            ratio from the last trading day of the company’s most recent fiscal
            year.


            The second data item uses the addition operator to calculate
            percentage of revenue exposure in the US and Japan for the same date
            as the first data item. Note that due to URI defintion of the plus
            sign, the **+** symbol must be URL percent encoded as **%2B** in GET
            requests. This means you should use **%2B** in place of the symbol
            **+** in the request.


            The third data item uses the average function (**AVG**) and the
            **IF** function to indicate whether the average daily price change
            over the company’s most recent fiscal year is postive or negative.

        Data model returned when the parameter **flatten=Y** is used in the

        **flatten=Y** can be conceptualized as a table (rows and columns) where
        each data object in the result is a row in the table and each field
        names is a column name. The response will contain at least one data
        object for each requestId containing the requestId, fsymId (if
        requested), date (if applicable) and Key-Value pairs for each data item
        (formula). The number of data objects (rows) per requestId is dependent
        the the objectTypes of the formulas requested.

        Formulas that have associated dates (TIMESERIES objectType in the
        standard **flatten=N** response model) will result in a data object for
        each date for each requestId.


        **flatten=N TIMESERIES Representation**

        ```json

        [
          {

        **flatten=Y TIMESERIES Representation**

        ```json

        [
          {
            "requestId": "id",

          }
        ]

        ```

        ---


        Formulas that result in an array (no associated dates, ARRAY objectType
        in the standard **flatten=N** response model) can be thought of as a
        column in a table. Each element in the array will be in a separate data
        object. The first element of the array starts in the first data object
        for that requestId and then then the second element of the array in the
        second data object for that requestId and so on (regardless of dates
        from other formulas).


        **flatten=N ARRAY Representation**

        ```json

        [
          {

            "requestId": "id",
            "formulaName": a,
          },
          {
            "requestId": "id",
            "formulaName": b,
          },
          {
            "requestId": "id",
            "formulaName": c,
          }
        ]

        ```

        ---

        Scalar data items (SCALAR objectType in the standard **flatten=N**
        response model) will be repeated in each data object for the requestId.


        **flatten=N SCALAR Representation**

        ```json

        [
          {
            "requestId": "id",

            "objectType": "ARRAY",
            "dataType": "DOUBLE"
          }

          {
            "requestId": "id",

          }
        ]

        ```

        ---

        Formulas that result in a matrix (2 dimensional array, MATRIX objectType
        in the standard **flatten=N** response model) can be thought of as
        returning a table where each array in the array of arrays is a row in
        the table. This can be extended to the flattened result structure where
        each data object is a row in a table.  The formula will have as many
        attributes (appended by [n]) as number of columns in the matrix result.


        **flatten=N MATRIX Representation**

        ```json

        [

                This is only required when submitting ids that are not supported
                by default. 


                Available symbol types -

                * DEFAULT - Accepted symbol types include Market Tickers,
                SEDOLs, ISINs, CUSIPs, or FactSet Permanent Ids.


                * BLOOMBERG - Accepted symbol types include Bloomberg Tickers
                and Bloomberg FIGIs. 
                  * When submitting Bloomberg symbols, the Bloomberg symbol is translated to a FactSet Permanent Identifier which is then used to retrieve the requested FQL and Screening formulas. The Bloomberg symbol submitted will be returned in the response in the field *requestId*. To see the FactSet Permanent Identifer that the Bloomberg symbol resolved to, use the `fsymId` parameter in addition to the `symbolType` parameter.
                  * Bloomberg symbols can not be submitted with other symbol types. 
                  * Bloomberg Symbol Resolution is not available via Batch Requests.
                  
                Bloomberg Symbol Resolution is included with the Individual User
                subscription. Users with a Production User subscription require
                additional access to submit Bloomberg symbols. If you would like
                to gain access to Bloomberg Symbol Resolution, please contact
                your FactSet Account Team or "Report Issue" above and our
                support teams can assist.

                The third data item uses the average function (**AVG**) and the
                **IF** function to indicate whether the average daily price
                change over the company’s most recent fiscal year was postive or
                negative.

                The second data item uses the addition operator to calculate
                percentage of revenue exposure in the US and Japan for the same
                date as the first data item.


                The third data item uses the **IF** function and greater than
                operator (**>**) to indicate whether the latest fiscal year's
                sales were higher or lower than the previous year's sales.

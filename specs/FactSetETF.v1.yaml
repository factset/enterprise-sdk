  description: >
    FactSet ETF data feeds provide complete and accurate security, fund and
    reference data across the universe of exchange-traded products. Data is
    sourced from ETF providers across the globe and includes more than 100
    unique data points, resulting in comprehensive coverage to help you evaluate
    and construct ETFs, analyze potential trades, and perform fund research.<p>
    FactSet Reference and Analytics data uses FactSet's FCS, which categorizes
    exchange-traded products using a rules-based system that is derived from
    seven core classifications. This system evaluates the asset class, economic
    development level, and geographical region as described in each fund's
    prospectus and marketing materials. ETF exposure details are presented on
    successively granular levels-  category, then focus, and then niche.</p>
    <p>Moreover, FactSet ETF Reference data captures over 100 unique data points
    and provides market-specific data if you wish to solely focus on U.S.,
    Canadian, Australian, New Zealand, Singapore, Hong Kong or European
    exchanges. All data points are grouped in one of two levels, either as a
    Fund or as a Listing. However, FactSet ETF Analytics data is primarily
    available for U.S.-domiciled ETFs. A subset of reference data items are
    provided for European-domiciled funds. For a full breakout of regional
    availability and history, see Formula Definitions and Calculations.</p>

              * **DOUBLE** - A double is a FactSet data type, similar to a float or an integer. A double represents numeric data but provides for a greater amount of decimal precision than the float data type. Double values have up to 15 digits of precision, while float values have up to 7 digits (integers have up to 10 digits).
              * **INTEGER** - An integer is a whole number or zero (i.e., integers do not include decimals). Integers can be positive or negative.
              * **STRING** - A string value is an ASCII character. A string is a sequence of ASCII characters. String value and text value are synonymous. Function will hold data for multiple time-periods, as well as for many companies (i.e., two-dimensional value). The STRING_ARRAY function returns data using a vertical orientation (e.g., down a column)

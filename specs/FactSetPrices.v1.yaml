            proportion of their nominal or par value. Values are in base units.
            To value non-traded shares, the price of the parent equity provides
            the most appropriate approximation of what the non-traded shares
            would be worth in the open market. For unique companies with an ADR
            as the parent equity, since it is the only traded security
            associated with that company, when calculating company-level market
            value, the price of the ADR is used, but is scaled by the ADR ratio
            since there's not always a one-to-one relationship between ADR
            shares and the non-traded shares which they represent. For more

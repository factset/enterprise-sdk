    FactSet Revere Business Industry Classification System (RBICS) is a
    comprehensive structured taxonomy to classify companies by what they
    primarily do. It delivers a granular view for investors by classifying
    companies using a bottom-up approach according to the products and services
    they provide. By combining this approach with a top-level grouping based on
    companies' behavior similarities and stock co-movement, FactSet RBICS
    delivers unprecedented precision for 1,400+ sector groups.


    RBICS Focus is a six level classification which highlights the companys main
    business. It is based on the company business line/s that stand for majority
    of a the revenue that the company generates. Updated monthly. For more

          RBICS Focus offers a single-sector mapping of about 48,000 of the most liquid and publicly-traded companies based on their primary lines of business; it uses revenues as the key factor in determining a company’s primary line of business, by mapping a company to the lowest-level sector from which it derives 50% or more of its revenues.

        Designed to overcome disparate and non-standardized company disclosures,
        the RBICS taxonomy is a normalized global industry classification
        consisting of a fourteen-by-six matrix. There are twelve economies with
        two specialty sectors, each with six incremental detailed layers,
        resulting in over 1,600 sector groups.


        The top-levels' market-defined approach groups companies based on their
        behavioral similarities and stock price co-movement, while the patented
        product-based approach used in the lower levels enables the necessary
        precision to capture the specialty sectors of global markets.

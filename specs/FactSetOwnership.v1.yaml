    FactSet's Fund Ownership API gives access to both **Holdings** and
    **Holders** data.<p> Factset's Holdings endpoints gives access to all the
    underlying securities and their position detils held within a given fund.
    Fund Types supported include Open-End Mutual Funds, Closed-end Mutual Funds,
    and Exchange Traded Funds. Security Holders information retrieves all
    "holder types" and their positions across institutions, funds, insiders, and
    stakeholders.</p><p>The FactSet Ownership and Mutual Funds database collects
    global equity ownership data for approximately 50,000 institutions, 60,000
    unique Mutual Fund portfolios, and 400,000 Insider/Stake holders from around
    110 countries.  For more details review our [Data

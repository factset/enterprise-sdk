    <p>The Calendar Events API provides access to FactSetâ€™s Event Calendar
    data alongside business logic that allows users to replicate views and
    functionality consistent with the experience provided by the Workstation.
    This API provides the ability to pull Event Calendar data based on specific
    filters.</p>

    <p>Events Audio API provides access to historical as well as the latest
    audio recordings of various company events covered by FactSet. The events
    include, but are not limited to: earnings calls, conferences, and investor
    days. This API also provides relevant metadata such as timestamps and
    identifiers around each audio file.</p>

    <p>The  Near Real-time Transcripts API enables access to Near Real-time
    Transcripts provided by CallStreet to time-sensitive clients. This API also
    provides the relevant speaker metadata along with their confidence scores.
    This data caters to quant clients interested in building machine learning
    models. Clients can leverage this API to perform sentiment analysis through
    natural language processing or machine learning. It can also be used to
    complement analysis using FactSet's transcripts service.</p>

    <p>Transcripts API provides conference call transcripts for companies'
    publicly held conference calls and a wealth of information regarding
    upcoming corporate events, such as conference call date and time, phone
    number and password, type of conference call, and important company investor
    relations contact information.</p>

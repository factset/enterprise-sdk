        the request has been received and is being processed. Use the batch
        status endpoint to check job progress, and retrieve results using the
        batch-result endpoint once processing is complete.

        Request Limits:
          - Non-batch (real-time) requests:
              * Single day: up to 500 IDs per request
              * Multi-day: up to 50 IDs per request

        When using batch mode, the number of unique currencies present in the
        requested IDs is limited to 50 per request. It is recommended to use the
        POST method for large ID lists, as GET requests are still subject to URL

    FactSet ESG (powered by FactSet Truvalue Labs) applies machine learning to
    uncover risks and opportunities from companies' Environmental, Social and
    Governance (ESG) behavior, which are aggregated and categorized into
    continuously updated, material ESG scores. The service focuses on company
    ESG behavior from external sources and includes both positive and negative
    events that go beyond traditional sources of ESG risk data.<p> FactSet ESG
    extracts, analyzes, and generates scores from millions of documents each
    month collected from more than 100,000 data sources in over 30 languages.
    Sources include news, trade journals, NGOs, watchdog groups, trade blogs,
    industry reports and social media. Products deliver investable insights by
    revealing value and risk factors from unstructured data at the speed of
    current events.</p>

        Industry classifications follow SICS, SASB's Industry Classification
        System. Using the Adjusted Insight scores, Industry Percentiles are
        generated for all companies. Companies with five or more articles in a

        The FactSet Truvalue Score types being requested. Score Types include

        Materiality Score, Adjusted Insight, and Industry Percentile. When left
        blank all score types will be returned for the requested Id. To specify
        select scores returned in the response, provide a comma-separated list
        of the scores using the description below.

        <p>These scores use the same underlying data and 100-point scale, except
        for ranks and percentiles. The cognitive computing system behind
        FactSet's Truvalue Platform uses natural language processing to
        interpret semantic content and generate analytics. It does so by
        applying criteria that are consistent with established sustainability
        and ESG frameworks, scoring data points on performance using a 0 to 100
        scale. A score of 50 represents a neutral impact. Scores above 50
        indicate positive performance, and scores below reflect negative
        performance.</p>


        ### ESG Score Types


        |**SASB Category Input**|**Description**|

        |---|---|

        |**PULSE**|*Pulse Score*, is a measure of near-term performance changes
        that highlights opportunities and controversies, enabling real-time
        monitoring of companies. It focuses on events of the day and provides a
        responsive signal to alert investors to dynamic moves.|

        |**INSIGHT**|*Insight Score*, a measure of a company’s longer-term ESG
        track record, similar to a ratings system. Scores are less sensitive to
        daily events and reflect the enduring performance record of a company
        over time. Scores are derived using an exponentially-weighted moving
        average of the Pulse, defined below, and the half-life of an event’s
        influence on the overall score is 6 months.|

        |**MOMENTUM**|*Momentum Score*, measures the trend of a company's
        Insight score. It is a unique ESG metric in the industry that gives
        investors a high-precision view of the trajectory of a company’s ESG
        performance, relative to peers. It does so by precisely articulating
        upward or downward movement, relative to that of all others in the
        universe, making it a measure that enhances quantitative workflows.|

        |**ART_VOL_TTM**|*Article Volume Score*, measures the information flow
        or number of articles about a company over the past 12 months.|

        |**CAT_VOL_TTM**|*Category Volume Score*, returns the total number of
        times any of the 26 categories received a score over a trailing
        twelve-month (TTM) period of time.|

        |**DYNAMIC_MAT**|*Dynamic Materiality Score*, shows the percentage value
        of data flow by category compared with the total data flow for the
        organization **(NOT VALID for `ALLCATEGORIES` and `MATERIALITY` category
        types).**|

        |**ADJ_INSIGHT**|*Adjusted Insight*, Measures company ESG performance,
        generating scores for lower-volume and zero-volume firms by blending
        company scores with industry medians. **(ONLY Vaild for `ALLCATEGORIES`
        and `MATERIALITY` categories). <p>**Adjusted Insight Score = (# of
        articles / 5) x Company Insight Score + ((5 - # of articles) / 5) x
        Industry (or Sector) Median Insight Score.</p>|

        |**IND_PCTL**|*Industry Percentile*, offers context on company Adjusted
        Insight scores relative to peers in the same SICS Industry. This value
        is used to establish the textual ESG Rank. **(ONLY Vaild for
        `ALLCATEGORIES` and `MATERIALITY` categories).**|


        ### Helper Input

        **ALL**= *Ability to fetch all of the "scoreTypes" listed above in a
        simplified query.* This is used by default and removes the need to

        <p>These scores use the same underlying data and 100-point scale, except
        for ranks and percentiles. The cognitive computing system behind
        FactSet's Truvalue Platform uses natural language processing to
        interpret semantic content and generate analytics. It does so by
        applying criteria that are consistent with established sustainability
        and ESG frameworks, scoring data points on performance using a 0 to 100
        scale. A score of 50 represents a neutral impact. Scores above 50
        indicate positive performance, and scores below reflect negative
        performance.</p>


        ### ESG Score Types


        |**SASB Category Input**|**Description**|

        |---|---|

        |**PULSE**|*Pulse Score*, is a measure of near-term performance changes
        that highlights opportunities and controversies, enabling real-time
        monitoring of companies. It focuses on events of the day and provides a
        responsive signal to alert investors to dynamic moves.|

        |**INSIGHT**|*Insight Score*, a measure of a company's longer-term ESG
        track record, similar to a ratings system. Scores are less sensitive to
        daily events and reflect the enduring performance record of a company
        over time. Scores are derived using an exponentially-weighted moving
        average of the Pulse, defined below, and the half-life of an event's
        influence on the overall score is 6 months.|

        |**MOMENTUM**|*Momentum Score*, measures the trend of a company's
        Insight score. It is a unique ESG metric in the industry that gives
        investors a high-precision view of the trajectory of a company's ESG
        performance, relative to peers. It does so by precisely articulating
        upward or downward movement, relative to that of all others in the
        universe, making it a measure that enhances quantitative workflows.|

        |**ART_VOL_TTM**|*Article Volume Score*, measures the information flow
        or number of articles about a company over the past 12 months.|

        |**CAT_VOL_TTM**|*Category Volume Score*, returns the total number of
        times any of the 26 categories received a score over a trailing
        twelve-month (TTM) period of time.|

        |**DYNAMIC_MAT**|*Dynamic Materiality Score*, shows the percentage value
        of data flow by category compared with the total data flow for the
        organization **(NOT VALID for `ALLCATEGORIES` and `MATERIALITY` category
        types).**|

        |**ADJ_INSIGHT**|*Adjusted Insight*, Measures company ESG performance,
        generating scores for lower-volume and zero-volume firms by blending
        company scores with industry medians. **(ONLY Vaild for `ALLCATEGORIES`
        and `MATERIALITY` categories). <p>**Adjusted Insight Score = (# of
        articles / 5) x Company Insight Score + ((5 - # of articles) / 5) x
        Industry (or Sector) Median Insight Score.</p>|

        |**IND_PCTL**|*Industry Percentile*, offers context on company Adjusted
        Insight scores relative to peers in the same SICS Industry. This value
        is used to establish the textual ESG Rank. **(ONLY Vaild for
        `ALLCATEGORIES` and `MATERIALITY` categories).**|


        ### Helper Input

              Amazon has asked federal regulators to block a number of
              shareholder proposals that strike to the heart of many recent
              criticisms of the Seattle-based commerce behemoth, including its
              stances on curbing hate speech and offensive content, diversity in
              hiring, workplace conditions for hourly warehouse employees and
              its surveillance technologies. According to letters filed Tuesday
              with the SEC, Amazon is now requesting the regulator block
              shareholder proposals asking the company to report on its efforts
              to check hate speech across its many platforms, consider qualified
              women and non-white candidates for open positions in all roles,
              add an hourly associate to its board of directors and assess
              whether its products with surveillance capabilities violate human
              rights. In the aftermath of the Jan. 6 uprising at the U.S.
              Capitol, media outlets reported that white-supremacist and
              far-right militants had found havens on Amazon's online
              marketplace and cloud-computing infrastructure.
              Conservative-dominated social network Parler, which Amazon booted
              from its cloud-computing service due to what it deemed was a
              proliferation of posts advocating violence, recently argued in
              court that even as one Amazon division was flagging abusive
              content for review, another was attempting to upsell Parler on
              enhanced cloud-computing technologies. Amazon has not issued
              objections to five other shareholder resolutions submitted in
              partnership with the religious group, including requests for
              reports on the company's facial recognition technology, efforts to
              reduce the use of plastic packaging and lobbying expenditures.

              Amazon's new Housing Equity Fund aims to create thousands of
              affordable housing units. E-commerce and technology behemoth
              Amazon announced its first round of funding toward its new Housing
              Equity Fund, featuring an investment of more than $567 million in
              a long-term plan to provide more affordable housing near its major
              offices. Announced on Wednesday, the company intends to build
              about 1,300 apartment homes near its new second headquarters in
              Arlington, Va., along with roughly 1,000 apartment units available
              near the original Puget Sound headquarters in Washington state.
              This commitment is the company's response to the jump in real
              estate prices accompanying its growth as Amazon brings talented
              workers to its locations with high-paying jobs. The fund will also
              expand inclusive housing through lower rates on home loans and
              partner with local nonprofits to preserve affordable housing
              options.

              Beginning with the iPhone 12 series, Apple has lost its ability to
              match chargers in its boxes, triggering a lawsuit. A team of
              students from Beijing University of Chemical Technology and
              National Donghwa University took Apple to court after Apple was
              told that it was not giving away the adapter charger for its new
              product, according to media reports on October 25. The plaintiff
              said that most consumers and even Apple employees were equally
              divided and resentful of the serious violations of consumers'
              legitimate rights and interests at Apple, but that most had become
              the silent majority. Some media raised objections to this: While
              Apple has canceled the supply of the charger for environmental
              reasons, the iPhone 12 charger is still in place, but not in the
              box, and Apple continues to manufacture. Furthermore, the iPhone
              12 box is provided with a Lightning to USB-C charging line, which
              is not compatible with the 5W charging head provided in the past;
              In other words, unless you upgrade from iPhone 11 Pro, you will
              pay for a charger or Lightning to USB-A cable.

              Just over a year since officially launching its Racial Equity and
              Justice Initiative (REJI) with a $100 million commitment, Apple is
              going to invest another $30 million to broaden its efforts even
              further. The new commitments will see Apple expand access to
              equity in education, elevate more app founders and technologists
              from underrepresented backgrounds, and invest further in criminal
              justice and environmental justice organizations. Apple today
              announced $30 million in new commitments as part of its Racial
              Equity and Justice Initiative (REJI), supporting students,
              innovators, and advocacy organizations that are leading the charge
              in creating a more inclusive, more just world. These new projects
              include a Global Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI) Equity
              Innovation Hub; expanded education initiatives for community
              colleges and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs);
              a new cohort of the Apple Entrepreneur Camp immersive tech lab for
              Hispanic/Latinx founders and developers; and funding for leaders
              working to advance criminal justice reform and environmental
              justice. Along with today's news of expanding access to equity in
              education with the Innovation Hub launching, elevating app
              founders and technologists from underrepresented backgrounds, and
              investing in criminal justice and environmental justice

              The price of virtual currency has jumped by more than 51% since
              January 1. Tesla has invested $1.5 billion in the and will start
              accepting virtual currency as a means of payment for the purchase
              of its cars, the group announced on Monday, February 8. Tesla
              explains that she recently changed her investment policy to
              diversify her sources of liquidity and increase flexibility so
              that she can pay her shareholders a lot.In this context, the board
              of directors, through the audit committee, gave the company the
              green light to invest in various financial assets, including
              bitcoin. The virtual currency created by anonymous people and
              managed by a decentralized network is particularly volatile, and
              its price is not always easy to determine. The volatility and
              anonymity it provides to its users is not welcomed by the
              authorities, who are calling for stricter regulation.

              , register or subscribe to save articles for later. Mark Gillies,
              a company spokesman, confirmed on Tuesday that the statement had
              been a pre-April Fool's Day joke after having insisted Monday that
              the release was legitimate and the name change accurate.
              Volkswagen's intentionally fake news release, highly unusual for a
              major public company, coincides with its efforts to repair its
              image as it tries to recover from a 2015 scandal in which it
              cheated on government emissions tests and allowed diesel-powered
              vehicles to illegally pollute the air. James Cox, who teaches
              corporate and securities law at Duke University, said the
              Securities and Exchange Commission should take action to deal with
              such misinformation, which can distort stock prices. Erik Gordon,
              a business and law professor at the University of Michigan, said
              he thought that for the SEC to be interested, it would have to
              believe that VW knowingly issued the fake news release to
              manipulate its stock price.

              Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said he hopes he is investigated by U.S.
              regulators over his online posts about the meme cryptocurrency
              dogecoin. The tech entrepreneur-who is currently the world's
              second richest person with a £176 billion net worth-has repeatedly
              referenced the token in recent weeks via his personal Twitter
              account, which has a vast reach of more than 48 million followers.
              Dogecoin was launched in 2013 using branding of a Shiba Inu dog
              from a then-popular internet meme, and has repeatedly been
              mentioned by Musk in the years since. Musk, who is well-documented
              as using internet memes, last tweeted about dogecoin on February
              24, when he shared an image of the dog from its branding planting
              a flag on the moon, a play on a phrase used in the community to
              describe price surges. In September 2018, Musk settled a
              securities fraud charge brought by the agency in retaliation for a
              tweet sent on August 7, 2018 that said he could take Tesla private
              at $420 per share.

              Whether the topic is transforming the automobile or conquering the
              next frontier of space, Elon Musk has shown a knack for
              captivating an audience beyond investors and science geeks. The
              norm-shattering entrepreneur, who has more than 41 million
              followers on Twitter and a fortune now estimated at more than $180
              billion, announced last month he had relocated to Texas and could
              not resist one last dig at the West Coast state. Musk quickly
              dropped the go-private effort, but became embroiled in a bitter
              dispute with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which
              charged Musk with fraud, slapped him with a $20 million fine, and
              demanded he step down as Tesla chairman and agree to follow
              board-supervised protocols on his social media use. Around the
              same time, Musk also publicly sparred with a British caver, who
              had mocked the Tesla CEO's offer of a mini-submarine to rescue
              young soccer players trapped in a cave in Thailand in the summer
              of 2018. But Musk -- and Tesla -- hit his stride in 2020, with the
              company impressively lifting output in California and Shanghai,
              breaking ground on new factories, and scoring a series of
              profitable quarters as its market value soared.

              LONDON (Reuters) -     Bitcoin soared above $50,000 on Tuesday to
              an all-time high, adding steam to a rally fuelled by signs that
              the world's biggest cryptocurrency is gaining acceptance among
              mainstream investors and companies. The move by Tesla, which also
              said it would accept bitcoin as payment, was the latest in a
              string of large investments that have vaulted bitcoin from the
              fringes of finance to company balance sheets and Wall Street, with
              U.S. firms and traditional money managers starting to buy the
              coin. Even as bitcoin laps into the mainstream, cryptocurrencies
              remain subject to patchy oversight around the world, with the lack
              of regulatory clarity and associations with crime keeping many
              larger investors leery of exposure. U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet
              Yellen and European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde both
              called last month for tighter oversight of bitcoin due to concerns
              over its use for criminal activities such as money laundering.
              U.S. business intelligence software firm MicroStrategy Inc, whose
              CEO has become one of bitcoin's most visible proponents, on
              Tuesday said it would issue $600 million of debt through
              convertible notes to buy additional bitcoin.

              According to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Tesla was
              told last year that Elon Musk had twice violated the settlement
              when he used Twitter, under which his tweets were subject to
              review and approval by Tesla lawyers. Tesla shares soared on
              August 7, 2018 after Mr. Musk said he would take the company
              private for $420 a share and said he had received financial
              support. In a letter to Tesla, the SEC said that Mr. Musk was
              still violating the agreements in 2019 and 2020 after the
              settlement, and that neither tweet had been approved. Another
              tweet, CNN said, was the May 1, 2020 tweet, which he complained
              about Tesla's stock price being too high, and which subsequently
              caused the company's share price to fall, losing more than $13bn
              in market value. CNN said the settlement showed that Mr. Musk
              needed approval to publish topics including Tesla's financial
              position, the relevant production figures or new lines of
              business.

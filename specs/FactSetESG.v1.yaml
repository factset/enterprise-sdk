    FactSet ESG (powered by FactSet Truvalue Labs) applies machine learning to
    uncover risks and opportunities from companies' Environmental, Social and
    Governance (ESG) behavior, which are aggregated and categorized into
    continuously updated, material ESG scores. The service focuses on company
    ESG behavior from external sources and includes both positive and negative
    events that go beyond traditional sources of ESG risk data.<p> FactSet ESG
    extracts, analyzes, and generates scores from millions of documents each
    month collected from more than 100,000 data sources in over 30 languages.
    Sources include news, trade journals, NGOs, watchdog groups, trade blogs,
    industry reports and social media. Products deliver investable insights by
    revealing value and risk factors from unstructured data at the speed of
    current events.</p>

        Industry Percentile Ranges is as follows -

        System. Using the Adjusted Insight scores, Industry Percentiles are
        generated for all companies. Companies with five or more articles in a
        year get ranked in a first pass, then companies with filled-in values
        are interpolated without forcing the ranking of higher-volume companies
        up or down.  In the case where a company falls into an industry with
        fewer than 7 high or medium volume companies the Sector Percentile is
        inserted in the place of the Industry Percentile score.

        ### SDG Score Types


        |**SDG Category Input**|**Description**|

        |---|---|

        |**PULSE**|*Pulse Score*, is a measure of near-term performance changes
        that highlights opportunities and controversies, enabling real-time
        monitoring of companies. It focuses on events of the day and provides a
        responsive signal to alert investors to dynamic moves.|

        |**INSIGHT**|*Insight Score*, a measure of a company's longer-term SDG
        track record, similar to a ratings system. Scores are less sensitive to
        daily events and reflect the enduring performance record of a company
        over time. Scores are derived using an exponentially-weighted moving
        average of the Pulse, defined below, and the half-life of an event's
        influence on the overall score is 6 months.|

        |**MOMENTUM**|*Momentum Score*, measures the trend of a company's
        Insight score. It is a unique ESG metric in the industry that gives
        investors a high-precision view of the trajectory of a company's SDG
        performance, relative to peers. It does so by precisely articulating
        upward or downward movement, relative to that of all others in the
        universe, making it a measure that enhances quantitative workflows.|

        |**DYNAMIC_MAT**|*Dynamic Materiality Score*, shows the percentage value
        of data flow by category compared with the total data flow for the
        organization |

        |**ADJ_INSIGHT**|*Adjusted Insight*, Measures company SDG performance,
        generating scores for lower-volume and zero-volume firms by blending
        company scores with industry medians. **(ONLY Vaild for `IMPACT`
        category)**. <p>**Adjusted Insight Score = (# of articles / 5) x Company
        Insight Score + ((5 - # of articles) / 5) x Industry (or Sector) Median
        Insight Score.</p>|

        |**IND_PCTL**|*Industry Percentile*, offers context on company Adjusted
        Insight scores relative to peers in the same SICS Industry. This value
        is used to establish the textual ESG Rank. **(ONLY Vaild for `IMPACT`
        category).**|

        |**TTM_VOLUME**|*TTM Volume*, measures the data flow over a trailing
        twelve month period.|

        |**SDG_RANK**|*SDG Rank*, offers rank leveraging the 16 ESG categories
        defined by Sustainable Development Goals (SDG).The datatype for the data
        returned when this score types is requested is String**(ONLY Vaild for

        management, such as by using of recycled and renewable materials,
        reducing the use of key materials (dematerialization), maximizing
        resource efficiency in manufacturing, and making R&D investments in
        substitute materials. Additionally, companies can manage these issues by
        screening, selection, monitoring, and engagement with suppliers to

        to incorporate climate change consideration in products and services
        sold, such as insurance policies and mortgages. The category relates to
        the company's ability to adapt to increased frequency and severity of
        extreme weather, shifting climate, sea level risk, and other expected
        physical impacts of climate change. Management may involve enhancing
        resiliency of physical assets and/or surrounding infrastructure as well

        ### ESG Score Types


        |**SASB Category Input**|**Description**|

        |---|---|

        |**PULSE**|*Pulse Score*, is a measure of near-term performance changes
        that highlights opportunities and controversies, enabling real-time
        monitoring of companies. It focuses on events of the day and provides a
        responsive signal to alert investors to dynamic moves.|

        |**INSIGHT**|*Insight Score*, a measure of a company's longer-term ESG
        track record, similar to a ratings system. Scores are less sensitive to
        daily events and reflect the enduring performance record of a company
        over time. Scores are derived using an exponentially-weighted moving
        average of the Pulse, defined below, and the half-life of an event's
        influence on the overall score is 6 months.|

        |**MOMENTUM**|*Momentum Score*, measures the trend of a company's
        Insight score. It is a unique ESG metric in the industry that gives
        investors a high-precision view of the trajectory of a company's ESG
        performance, relative to peers. It does so by precisely articulating
        upward or downward movement, relative to that of all others in the
        universe, making it a measure that enhances quantitative workflows.|

        |**ART_VOL_TTM**|*Article Volume Score*, measures the information flow
        or number of articles about a company over the past 12 months.|

        |**CAT_VOL_TTM**|*Category Volume Score*, returns the total number of
        times any of the 26 categories received a score over a trailing
        twelve-month (TTM) period of time.|

        |**DYNAMIC_MAT**|*Dynamic Materiality Score*, shows the percentage value
        of data flow by category compared with the total data flow for the
        organization **(NOT VALID for `ALLCATEGORIES` and `MATERIALITY` category
        types).**|

        |**ADJ_INSIGHT**|*Adjusted Insight*, Measures company ESG performance,
        generating scores for lower-volume and zero-volume firms by blending
        company scores with industry medians. **(ONLY Vaild for `ALLCATEGORIES`
        and `MATERIALITY` categories). <p>**Adjusted Insight Score = (# of
        articles / 5) x Company Insight Score + ((5 - # of articles) / 5) x
        Industry (or Sector) Median Insight Score.</p>|

        |**IND_PCTL**|*Industry Percentile*, offers context on company Adjusted
        Insight scores relative to peers in the same SICS Industry. This value
        is used to establish the textual ESG Rank. **(ONLY Vaild for
        `ALLCATEGORIES` and `MATERIALITY` categories).**|

        these risks through product design, manufacturing, and end-of-life
        management, such as by using of recycled and renewable materials,
        reducing the use of key materials (dematerialization), maximizing
        resource efficiency in manufacturing, and making R&D investments in
        substitute materials. Additionally, companies can manage these issues by
        screening, selection, monitoring, and engagement with suppliers to

        to incorporate climate change consideration in products and services
        sold, such as insurance policies and mortgages. The category relates to
        the company's ability to adapt to increased frequency and severity of
        extreme weather, shifting climate, sea level risk, and other expected
        physical impacts of climate change. Management may involve enhancing
        resiliency of physical assets and/or surrounding infrastructure as well
        as incorporation of climate change-related considerations into key

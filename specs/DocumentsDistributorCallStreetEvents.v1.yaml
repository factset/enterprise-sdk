    events data such as Events Audio and Near Real-Time Transcripts.

    audio recordings of various company events covered by FactSet. The events
    include, but are not limited to: earnings calls, conferences, and investor
    days. 


    This API also provides relevant metadata such as timestamps and identifiers
    around each audio file.


    The Documents Distributor - Near Real-time Transcripts API enables access to
    Near Real-time Transcripts provided by CallStreet to time-sensitive clients.
    This API also provides the relevant speaker metadata along with their
    confidence scores. This data caters to quant clients interested in building
    machine learning models.


    Clients can leverage this API to perform sentiment analysis through natural
    language processing or machine learning. It can also be used to complement
    analysis using FactSet's transcripts service.

                  ReportID can have multiple AudioSourceIDs.


                  The audioSourceId identifier is available for audio calls

                  value. All the vendor and trimmed audio files will have an
                  audioSourceId value of null.

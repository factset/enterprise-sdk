    The Option Prices database provides pricing data such as mid bid-ask price,
    reference data (e.g., strike price), and risk measures (e.g., Greeks and
    implied volatility). Visit [Options Overview OA Page #
    14925](https://my.apps.factset.com/oa/pages/14925) for details on database
    coverage. U.S. exchange-traded option bid and ask quotes are continuously
    updated throughout the day even when no trades have occurred on the option
    (zero volume). The end-of-day closing bid and ask quotes are always in line
    with the underlying closing price.


    **Note**

    * Currently in Beta only **OPRA** exchanges are supported.

      operationId: getOptionsGreeksForList
      description: >
        Returns all the greeks details for the specified option identifier.
        Greeks provide quantifiable factors for measuring the option's price
        sensativity. Greeks include -


        |Greek|Description|

        |---|---|

        |Delta| The ratio comparing the change in the price of the underlying
        asset to the corresponding change in the price of a derivative.
        Sometimes referred to as the "hedge ratio". For example, with respect to
        call options, a delta of 0.7 means that for every $1 the underlying
        stock increases, the call option will increase by $0.70. Put option
        deltas, on the other hand, will be negative, because as the underlying
        security increases, the value of the option will decrease. So a put
        option with a delta of -0.7 will decrease by $0.70 for every $1 the
        underlying increases in price. As an in-the-money call option nears
        expiration, it will approach a delta of 1.00, and as an in-the-money put
        option nears expiration, it will approach a delta of -1.00.|

        |Gamma| The rate of change for delta with respect to the underlying
        asset's price. Mathematically, gamma is the first derivative of delta
        and is used when trying to gauge the price of an option relative to the
        amount it is in or out of the money. When the option being measured is
        deep in or out of the money, gamma is small. When the option is near the
        money, gamma is largest.|

        |Rho|The rate at which the price of a derivative changes relative to a
        change in the risk-free rate of interest. Rho measures the sensitivity
        of an option or options portfolio to a change in interest rate.|

        |Theta|A measure of the rate of decline in the value of an option due to
        the passage of time. Theta can also be referred to as the time decay on
        the value of an option. If everything is held constant, then the option
        will lose value as time moves closer to the maturity of the option. For
        example, if the strike price of an option is $1,150 and theta is 53.80,
        then in theory the value of the option will drop $53.80 per day. The
        measure of theta quantifies the risk that time imposes on options as
        options are only exercisable for a certain period of time.|

        |Vega|The amount that the price of an option changes compared to a 1%
        change in volatility. Vega changes when there are large price movements
        in the underlying asset and vega falls as the option gets closer to
        maturity. Vega can change even if there is no change in the price of the
        underlying asset, this would happen if there is a change in expected
        volatility. For example, if the vega of an option is -96.94 and if
        implied volatility were to rise by 1% then the option value would fall
        by $96.94.|


        Note
          * Each step in the binomial model represents a change in time, therefore, point estimates of the Greeks can be calculated for American options. The following can be used to calculate the Greeks for the Binomial Option Pricing Model (BOPM) pricing model, using the notation fstep,node so f1,1 represents the option price at the first step, top node (nodes are counted at each step starting with 0 at the bottom. See [Constructing the Tree](https://my.apps.factset.com/oa/pages/17735#tree) for more information).

        Returns the at-the-money (ATM) implied volatility details for the
        specified underlying security identifier
      operationId: getOptionsATMImpliedVolatilityForList
      description: >
        Returns weighted average of the implied volatilities from the options
        listed for a specified security identifier. 


        There are three different methods available for calculating at-the-money
        implied volatility (ATM IV), which gives a weighted average of the
        implied volatilities from the options listed on a given stock. They are
        ATM IV (Filtered), ATM IV (Filtered with Smoothing), and ATM IV
        (Market). Each of these ATM IV calculations is available for just the
        calls on a given stock, just the puts, or the composite of both the
        calls and puts.

        This at-the-money implied volatility market can calculated for different
        periods -

        * One Month

        * Two Months

        * Three Months

        * Four Months

        * Five Months

        * Six Months

          *Currently only OPRA Exchange traded options are supported*

            referred to as the "hedge ratio". For example, with respect to call
            options, a delta of 0.7 means that for every $1 the underlying stock
            increases, the call option will increase by $0.70. Put option
            deltas, on the other hand, will be negative, because as the
            underlying security increases, the value of the option will
            decrease. So a put option with a delta of -0.7 will decrease by
            $0.70 for every $1 the underlying increases in price. As an
            in-the-money call option nears expiration, it will approach a delta
            of 1.00, and as an in-the-money put option nears expiration, it will
            approach a delta of -1.00.

            |---|---|

            |0|American|

            |1|European|


            An American style option can be exercised anytime during its life.
            The majority of exchange-traded options are American. 


            Since investors have the freedom to exercise their American options
            at any point during the life of the contract, they are more valuable
            than European options which can only be exercised at maturity. 


            Consider this example- If you bought a Ford March Call option
            expiring in March of 2006, in March 2005 you would have the right to
            exercise the call option at anytime up until its expiration date.
            Had the Ford option been a European option, you could only exercise
            the option at the expiry date in March 2006. During the year, the
            share price could have been most optimal for exercise in December of
            2005, but you would have to wait to exercise your option until March
            2006, where it could be out of the money and virtually worthless.
            The name of this option style has nothing to do with the geographic
            location.

            |---|---|

            |0|American|

            |1|European|


            An American style option can be exercised anytime during its life.
            The majority of exchange-traded options are American.


            Since investors have the freedom to exercise their American options
            at any point during the life of the contract, they are more valuable
            than European options which can only be exercised at maturity.


            Consider this example -  If you bought a Ford March Call option
            expiring in March of 2006 in March 2005, you would have the right to
            exercise the call option at anytime up until its expiration date.
            Had the Ford option been a European option, you could only exercise
            the option at the expiry date in March '06. During the year, the
            share price could have been most optimal for exercise in December of
            2005, but you would have to wait to exercise your option until March
            2006, where it could be out-of-the-money and virtually worthless.


            Note that the name of this option style has nothing to do with the
            geographic location.

            * In general, implied volatility increases when the market is
            bearish and decreases when the market is bullish. This is due to the
            common belief that bearish markets are more risky than bullish
            markets.


            * In addition to known factors such as market price, interest rate,
            expiration date, and strike price, implied volatility is used in
            calculating an option's premium.

    ### OVERVIEW


    The FactSet Conversational API allows clients to integrate core FactSet
    Mercury capabilities in chatbot experiences.


    The Conversational API is powered by FactSet Mercury, FactSet's Generative
    Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) large language model. The Conversational API
    provides a variety of content and capabilities, including FactSet’s
    Federation layer (FactSet’s core GenAI-based technology), as well as more
    specific content and functionality tailored for financial services
    workflows.


    The Conversational API provides answers to hundreds of natural language
    search queries and allows you to easily ask questions related to companies
    and markets research.


    Some example supported prompts:


    - Nintendo's highest closing stock price over the last 3 months

    - Has Yelp issued any guidance?

    - What are the key trends impacting costs for DaVita?


    **For Information on Access to and Content Available via the Conversational
    API**


    Please see the [Conversational API Online Assistant
    Page](https://my.apps.factset.com/oa/pages/23209). Here you can find
    instructions on how to set up access to the Conversational API, and the full
    list of content available.


    #### Conversational API Consumer Workflow


    The Conversational API is an asynchronous API that utilizes status polling
    to inform the consumer when a query response is complete. Please see the
    technical OpenAPI documentation below for specific information regarding
    consuming the API programmatically.


    At a high level, the API consumer workflow is as follows:


    1) Send a natural language query to the `/query` endpoint and start the
    response generation process.

    2) Poll the status of the response generation process using the `/status`
    endpoint.

    3) Once the status indicates a ready response, retrieve it using the
    `/result` endpoint. 

    - If your response contains a file ID, such as for an Excel chart or a
    [FactSet ActiveGraph](https://my.apps.factset.com/oa/pages/20355), retrieve
    it using the file ID at the `/download/file` endpoint.

    - To provide feedback on your response and help the Conversational API
    better serve you content, we encourage you to use the `/feedback` endpoint.

    #### FAQ & Troubleshooting

    Please find FAQs and troubleshooting tips in the [FAQs
    section](https://my.apps.factset.com/oa/pages/23440) of the Conversational
    API OA page


    ##### Current Limitations


    - "Natural language" in this documentation refers to modern conversational
    English. Support for other languages is currently unavailable.

    - The Conversational API is currently limited to accept 10 natural language
    queries per minute and 200 per hour for an individual consumer. If you
    anticipate your needs to be greater than these limits, please reach out to
    FactSet Support.

      description: >
        Use this endpoint to send a natural language query to FactSet Mercury,
        our large language model for surfacing FactSet datasets through
        conversational natural language queries.

        A request to `/query` will initiate the response generation process for
        the given query. Queries can be sent as standalone questions or as part
        of a conversational message chain, using a chat ID to maintain context.


        Responses from `/query` contain the following:

        * **jobId**: used in subsequent endpoints to poll the status of response
        generation and retrieve the response from FactSet Mercury.

        * **chatId**: optionally used to ask further questions in the same
        conversational message chain.


        Please see the [Conversational API Online Assistant
        page](https://my.apps.factset.com/oa/pages/23209) for details around
        available content and types of questions the Conversational API can
        answer.

        Use this endpoint to retrieve the results of your query to FactSet
        Mercury. This endpoint is the final step in the query polling process.
        Once the status for your jobId is `created`, you can retrieve the query
        response using this `/result` endpoint.


        The response will contain the natural language answer to your query,
        supporting data and content that FactSet Mercury has surfaced, and
        suggestions for further engagement with FactSet Mercury. 


        Data and content will be returned using various defined and standard
        formats, such as markdown and Microsoft Adaptive Cards. Please see the
        examples and data schemas associated with the `/result` endpoint for
        details.


        **Please note:** The ID contained in the response represents the ID for
        the response itself, it does not match the chatId or jobId. Please use
        this response ID at the `/feedback` endpoint to provide feedback on the
        response.

        Response text from the Conversational API may contain `citations` which
        provide references to the source of the data in the textual response. If
        provided, phrases within the response text will be mapped to a data item
        in the `citations` object via a bracketed ID (e.g. `[1]`). Citations may
        be used to provide additional context or to verify the source of the
        data; in some cases, a single phrase within the response may be
        supported by multiple data sources. Links to the source data are
        provided as links to FactSet's Document Viewer (see OA page
        [here](https://my.apps.factset.com/oa/pages/17390)). If available, the

                      FactSet announced the release of Transcript Assistant, a
                      GenAI-powered, conversational chatbot that accelerates
                      in-depth research and analysis of earnings call
                      transcripts. Transcript Assistant leverages generative AI
                      (GenAI) to help users search, analyze, and extract
                      valuable, actionable insights from all transcripts in
                      FactSet, ultimately enhancing the investment research
                      process within the FactSet Workstation. The interactive
                      tool allows users to submit custom queries regarding the
                      transcript in a two-way interface that goes beyond
                      earnings summarizations, such as, 'How is the company
                      discussing the impact of a U.S. recession?'. From there,
                      the large language models identify, synthesize, and
                      surface relevant transcript information to help users
                      maximize efficiency and unlock insights that inform

                      Q&A Summary (Call Time: 21-Sep-23 11:00 ET): Management is
                      bullish on the wealth space, seeing opportunities in
                      adjacent workflows and expecting growth despite pressure
                      across most firm types. Guidance for 2024 anticipates
                      similar growth on the buy side, slower growth in banking,
                      acceleration in wealth, and a more constructive
                      environment in the partners business. Price realization
                      improved across workstation packages in 2023, contributing
                      to the 2024 outlook. However, impact from price increases
                      is expected to be less than in 2023. Adjusted operating
                      margin guidance for 2024 is ahead of 2025 expectations,
                      with potential margin expansion driven by workforce, real
                      estate, and third-party data growth control. GenAI is
                      expected to improve client experience and drive new
                      desktops, with potential for new products and off-platform
                      opportunities. Some GenAI products are expected to come to
                      market in 2024. Employee count growth is expected to
                      continue at about 5% in 2024, with the majority of hires
                      in centers of excellence. Expense growth in 2024 is
                      expected to be heavier towards the back half of the year,
                      particularly in Q4. This summary was generated using LLM
                      technology optimized by StreetAccount. Editor's note

                      And then with our continued investment in content around
                      deep sector, private markets and the technology investment
                      we're making now around generative AI, I think there's a
                      massive opportunity for us not just across banking, but
                      across some of the smaller firm types that we deal with
                      like private equity, corporates and even hedge funds where
                      we may not have played as much in the past. So I think
                      we're set up very nicely here. And I think when the market
                      turns, I think we'll really be able to capitalize on this.

                      Hi, Ashish. It's Helen. Thank you for that question. I
                      think from our perspective, I don't want to say we've hit
                      a bottom. That's too strong of a word. But when I think
                      about this year and last year, I would expect that two
                      things to happen. One is that the erosion reduction will
                      actually be more leveled off, and I think that's an
                      important thing to sort of keep in mind. Banking isn't –
                      is key, but we actually grew the number of seats in
                      banking overall. Please keep in mind that part of that
                      isn't just around the clients that we have, but the new
                      clients that we win, and we have a couple of very good
                      opportunities. So we look at that as part of our – when we
                      talk to firm type. The second is pricing, which in the
                      past, I think we've talked about a third, a third, a
                      third. I think from a pricing perspective, it actually
                      added more this year from a percent basis than in the
                      past. We see it continuing to add in 2024 although closer
                      back down to maybe 1/4 or less than 1/3. And I think
                      that's probably more of the – a bit of a headwind that I
                      would look to than necessarily just thinking about seats.
                      So, that's how I would take a look at some of the – what's
                      built into our guidance.

                      2021.

                      Business Strategy

                      Our strategy is to build the leading open content and
                      analytics platform and powerful enterprise solutions that
                      deliver a differentiated advantage for our clients’
                      success. By offering personalized digital products, we
                      strive to be a trusted partner and service provider,
                      delivering relevant insights and research ideas tailored
                      to our clients' specific business models.

                      To execute our strategy, we have outlined the following
                      key initiatives:

                      • Expanding our Digital Platform: We are scaling up our
                      content refinery to provide a comprehensive inventory of
                      industry, proprietary and third-party data. This includes
                      granular data for key industry verticals, real-time data,
                      fund data and sustainable finance. Through an open
                      ecosystem of cloud-based data and analytics, we aim to
                      offer flexible solutions and content accessible through
                      various delivery methods. In addition, we are working to
                      expand our use of artificial intelligence to drive
                      efficiencies for our clients, with anticipated initiatives
                      including automation of tasks and integration of natural
                      language queries. We believe that our breadth of
                      high-quality, connected content will be a critical raw
                      material for large language models.

                      • Ensuring Execution Excellence: Innovation and
                      collaboration are at the core of our approach. We employ
                      technology to accelerate content collection, data
                      connectivity and the development of summaries and themes.
                      Our sales force is committed to enhancing price
                      realization, productivity, efficiency and improved client
                      outcomes. We are also optimizing operations and managing
                      expenses to improve returns on our investments.

                      • Fostering a Growth Mindset: We prioritize recruiting,
                      training and empowering a diverse and efficient workforce.
                      We are driving sustainable growth by investing in talent
                      that can create leading technological solutions and
                      efficiently execute our strategy. Additionally, strategic
                      partnerships and acquisitions help to accelerate our
                      expansion in key areas.

                      We are focused on growing our global business through
                      three strategically aligned geographic segments: the
                      Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific. This approach allows us
                      to better manage resources, target solutions and interact
                      with clients effectively. We executed on our growth
                      strategy during fiscal 2023 by offering data, products and
                      analytical applications for three workflow solutions:
                      Research & Advisory; Analytics & Trading; and CTS.

                      Hey, Alex, it's Helen. Yeah, I'm happy to try to answer
                      that question, so thank you. You're right, we're early in
                      the year but we have greater visibility, of course, in our
                      first half, so I'll talk to that specifically. We are
                      expecting current market conditions in the first half –
                      I'm going to go by firm type here – so when you talk about
                      buy-side, we actually finished the year quite strong with
                      both asset owners and hedge funds. So, the three things
                      that we see right now in the pipeline is, one, we're
                      continuing to gain traction in the middle office, so
                      building off of some of the great wins we had in the asset
                      servicing space, we would expect that to continue. Second,
                      we're seeing strong demand in the data feeds business, so,
                      both for company data as well as our data management
                      solutions, where we're really leveraging the strength of
                      our concordance for content for clients. We had two
                      significant wins, one in real-time, one in  tech data
                      (00:34:57), both displacing competitors. And a result,
                      we're getting inbound discussions around that. So, that's
                      also filling up our pipeline. And then third, as Phil
                      mentioned earlier, the strength in offerings we have in

                      Yeah. We feel good about the 6% to 8%, Manav. That's why
                      we put it out there. I think if we break it down by firm
                      type, we anticipate doing about the same level of growth
                      on the buy-side as we did this year. And as you know,
                      we've been evolving into more of a solutions provider for
                      our clients. So, despite head count pressure, which we
                      certainly did see on the buy-side, we still think there's
                      a great opportunity to take market share. We are
                      anticipating slower growth within banking. There are some
                      things in the pipeline that I think Helen might be able to
                      speak to, but we're not anticipating a blockbuster hiring
                      year in banking as part of our algorithm. We just spoke
                      about Wealth, so we're definitely anticipating some
                      acceleration on the Wealth side. And then in the Partners
                      part of our business, which we're now separating out a
                      bit, we're expecting a more constructive environment
                      there. We actually had – it wasn't a great year for us in
                      that part of the business. I'm not talking about CGS,
                      CUSIP. I'm talking about the rest of the Partners
                      business. So, Helen, do you want give some more commentary
                      on the pipeline?

                      Our use of artificial intelligence technologies may not be
                      successful and may present business, compliance, and
                      reputational risks

                      We use, and will expand our use of, machine learning and
                      artificial intelligence ("AI") technologies in some of our
                      products and processes. If we fail to keep pace with
                      rapidly evolving AI technological developments, our
                      competitive position and business results may be
                      negatively impacted. Our use of AI technologies will
                      require resources to develop, test and maintain such
                      products, which could be costly. Third parties may be able
                      to use AI to create technology that could reduce demand
                      for our products. In addition, the introduction of AI
                      technologies, particularly generative AI, into new or
                      existing offerings may result in new or expanded risks and
                      liabilities, due to enhanced governmental or regulatory
                      scrutiny, litigation, compliance issues, ethical concerns,
                      confidentiality, data privacy or security risks, as well
                      as other factors that could adversely affect our business,
                      reputation, and financial results. For example, use of AI
                      technologies could lead to unintended consequences, such
                      as accuracy issues, cybersecurity risks, unintended
                      biases, and discriminatory outputs, could impact our
                      ability to protect our data, intellectual property, and
                      client information, or could expose us to intellectual
                      property claims by third parties.

                      Strategy & Market Demand Risks

                      Competition in our industry may cause price reductions or
                      loss of market share

                      We continue to experience intense competition across all
                      markets for our products, with competitors ranging in size
                      from smaller, highly specialized, single-product
                      businesses to multi-billion-dollar companies. While we
                      believe the breadth and depth of our suite of products and
                      applications offer benefits to our clients that are a
                      competitive advantage, our competitors may offer price
                      incentives to attract new business. Future competitive
                      pricing pressures may result in decreased sales volumes
                      and price reductions, resulting in lower revenues and ASV.
                      Weak economic conditions may also result in clients
                      seeking to utilize lower-cost information that is
                      available from alternative sources. The impact of
                      cost-cutting pressures across the industries we serve
                      could lower demand for our products. Clients within the
                      financial services industry that strive to reduce their
                      operating costs may seek to reduce their spending on
                      financial market data and related services, such as ours.
                      If our clients consolidate their spending with fewer
                      suppliers, by selecting suppliers with lower-cost
                      offerings or by self-sourcing their needs for financial
                      market data, our business could be negatively affected.

                      The continued shift from active to passive investing could
                      negatively impact user count growth and revenues

                      The predominant investment strategy today is still active
                      investing, which attempts to outperform the market. The
                      main advantage of active management is the expectation
                      that the investment managers will be able to outperform
                      market indices.

                      Q&A Summary (Call Time: 21-Mar-24 11:00 ET): Client
                      activity is picking up, with increased pressure on
                      headcount and strength in enterprise solutions and
                      platform solutions. Expect a healthier pipeline in H2
                      versus H1, with higher deal volume. The pipeline is
                      stronger than last year, with half coming from the buy
                      side. Managed services represent a smaller part of the
                      business but offer good opportunities for clients to
                      outsource solutions to FactSet. Growth in price increase
                      was $25M this quarter, in line with FY 2022, although
                      lower than FY 2023. Total new business ASV has increased
                      due to higher new logos. Expenses are expected to ramp up
                      through the calendar year, leading to lower margins in Q3
                      and Q4 compared to Q1 and Q2. A large number of
                      seven-figure deals are present in the pipeline. Despite
                      pressure on headcount, there's an opportunity for growth
                      by tying front office to middle office operations. The
                      company anticipates lower organic ASV growth and GAAP
                      revenue at the lower end of guidance due to factors like
                      CS-UBS merger impact and a large Wealth cancelation event.

        Retrieves FactSet Fundamental standardized data for specified
        securities. Use the ```/metrics``` endpoint to retrieve a full list of
        valid metrics or data items.



        The ```/fundamentals``` endpoint currently supports Long Running
        asynchronous requests up to **20 minutes** via batch parameter. Id
        limits are increased to 2000 ids per request when using batch
        capability. This 2000 id limit has been derived based on single metric
        for one day. This feature is available for all users.

        Fundamentals standardized data. As Reported will be available in future
        endpoints. Leave Category and Subcategory blank to request all available
        items. The Endpoint Data model is optimized for time-series data with
        periodicity. Some items in this list are non-time series.

        Enables the ability to asynchronously "batch" the request, supporting a
        long-running request for up to 20 minutes. Upon requesting batch=Y, the
        service will respond with an HTTP Status Code of 202.

        Once a batch request is submitted, use batch status to see if the job
        has been completed. Once completed, retrieve the results of the request
        via batch-result. When using Batch, ids limit is increased to 30000 ids
        per request, though limits on query string via GET method still apply.
        It's advised to submit large lists of ids via POST method.

            The data type for the metric. Make note, mixing data types within a
            single /fundamentals API is not supported. Each dataType is defined
            below -
              * **date** - date format expressed in YYYY-MM-DD.
              * **doubleArray** - A double is a FactSet data type, similar to a float or an integer. A double represents numeric data but provides a greater amount of decimal precision than the float data type. Double values have up to 15 digits of precision, while float values have up to 7 digits (integers have up to 10 digits).
              * **float** - A float value is a real number (i.e., a number that can contain a fractional part/decimals). A float value has a precision of up to seven digits and accurately represents numbers whose absolute value is less than 16,277,216 (224). An example metric includes
              * **floatArray** - Function will hold data for multiple periods, as well as for many companies (i.e., two-dimensional value). The FLOATARRAY function returns data using a vertical orientation (e.g., down a column). The difference between FLOAT and FLOATARRAY is that FLOAT can only go across a row (one-dimension; horizontal orientation; vertical length=1) whereas FLOATARRAY will return data both across a row and down a column (two-dimensions; vertical orientation). With FLOATARRAY, the number of data points across a row will correspond to the number of companies queried; the number of data points down a column will correspond to the length of the time series.
              * **intArray** - An integer is a whole number or zero (i.e., integers do not include decimals). Integers can be positive or negative.
              * **string** - A string value is an ASCII character. A string is a sequence of ASCII characters. String value and text value are synonymous. The function will hold data for multiple time periods, as well as for many companies (i.e., two-dimensional value). The STRING_ARRAY function returns data using a vertical orientation (e.g., down a column)
              * **stringArray** - The difference between STRING and STRINGARRAY is that STRING can only go across a row (one-dimension; horizontal orientation; vertical length=1) whereas STRINGARRAY will return data both across a row and down a column (two-dimensions; vertical orientation). With STRINGARRAY, the number of data points across a row will correspond to the number of companies queried; the number of data points down a column will correspond to the length of the time series.

              Represents as reported total value of resources the company is
              using for its operations. Company assets are expected to provide
              future economic benefits in the entire course of business. Most of
              these are convertible into cash which can be used to cover any
              obligations. Thus, this is equal to the company&rsquo;s
              liabilities and total equity.


              It includes:

              -  Negative Goodwill


              -  Goodwill (reported as part of Liabilities)


              -  Due to associated companies


              -  Subscription receivable


              -  Deferred tax assets


              -  Advances on export contracts (reported as deduction within
              Receivables by Brazilian companies)


              It excludes:

              -  Own shares


              -  Unrealized foreign exchange loss


              -  Retained losses (reported as part of Assets)


              -  Uncalled capital


              This will be equal to the as reported total assets value if the
              items stated above are not reported.

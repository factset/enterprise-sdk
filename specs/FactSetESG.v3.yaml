    FactSet ESG (powered by FactSet Truvalue) applies Natural Language
    Processing and Machine Learning to uncover risks and opportunities from
    companies' Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) behavior, which are
    aggregated and categorized into continuously updated, material ESG scores.
    The service focuses on company ESG behavior from external sources and
    includes both positive and negative events that go beyond traditional
    sources of ESG risk data.<p> FactSet ESG extracts, analyzes, and generates
    scores from millions of documents each month collected from more than
    200,000 data sources in over 38 languages. Sources include news, trade
    journals, NGOs, watchdog groups, trade blogs and industry reports. Products
    deliver investable insights by revealing value and risk factors from
    unstructured data at the speed of current events.</p>

        ### Truvalue Fields

        |**Truvalue Fields Inputs**|**Description**|

        |---|---|

        |**TOPLEVEL**| This category represents a comprehensive overview of a
        company's Truvalue Score by integrating two key perspectives:
        ALLCATEGORIES and MATERIALITY.|

        ||**ALLCATEGORIES**  represents a company's overall Truvalue Score for
        the specific 'scoreType'. This value is equal to the cumulative average
        of all 26 SASB categories for the specific 'scoreType'. **Note** that
        category is not available for the Dynamic Materiality 'scoreType'.

        ||**MATERIALITY**  represents a composite score of all 'material' SASB
        categories for the given entity.|

        |**PILLARS**| Pillars are high-level categorizations of **Environmental,
        Social, and Governance** factors used to organize and group the 26 SASB
        categories. The three main pillars are Environmental, Social, and
        Governance. Each pillar encompasses several SASB categories that are
        thematically related. Pillars provide a broad framework for
        understanding and assessing a company's SASB performance and risks
        across these three fundamental areas.|

        |**DIMENSIONS**|Dimensions offer a more nuanced classification system
        for the 26 SASB categories, breaking them down into five distinct areas:
        **Environment, Business Model and Innovation, Human Capital, Leadership
        and Governance, and Social Capital**. This framework provides a more
        detailed and comprehensive view of a company's sustainability related
        activities, allowing for a more granular analysis of performance and
        risk across these five key dimensions of business operations and
        impact.|

        |**SASBCATEGORIES**| The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board
        (SASB) has developed a comprehensive set of 26 sustainability-related
        business topics, often referred to as general sustainability issues.
        These categories are integral to SASB's Materiality Map, which
        identifies the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) issues most
        likely to be material for companies across different industries. The
        categories span crucial areas such as Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Air
        Quality, Energy Management, Water and Waste Management, Ecological
        Impacts, Human Rights, Labor Practices, Product Safety, Data Security,
        Business Ethics, and Systemic Risk Management, among others. Each
        category is crafted to capture specific sustainability risks and
        opportunities that may impact a company's financial condition, operating
        performance, or risk profile. By providing a standardized framework and
        leveraging the Materiality Map, SASB facilitates more effective
        communication between companies and investors regarding the
        sustainability matters most pertinent to financial performance. |

        ### SASB Categories

        |**SASB Category Inputs**|**Description**|

        |---|---|

        |**AllCategories**|**AllCategories** - This category represents a
        company's overall SASB Score for the specific 'scoreType'. This value is
        equal to the cumulative average of all 26 SASB categories for the
        specific 'scoreType'. **Note** - AllCategories is not available for the
        Dynamic Materiality 'scoreType'.|

        |**AccessAndAffordability**|**Access and Affordability** - The category
        addresses a company's ability to ensure broad access to its products and
        services, specifically in the context of underserved markets and/or
        population groups. It includes the management of issues related to
        universal needs, such as the accessibility and affordability of health
        care, financial services, utilities , education, and
        telecommunications.<p>The category falls under the following Pillar and
        Dimension</p><p>**Pillar** - Social </p><p>**Dimension** - Social
        Capital </p>|

        |**AirQuality**|**Air Quality** - The category addresses management of
        air quality impacts resulting from stationary (e.g., factories, power
        plants) and mobile sources (e.g., trucks, delivery vehicles, planes) as
        well as industrial emissions. Relevant airborne pollutants include, but
        are not limited to, oxides of nitrogen (NOx), oxides of sulfur (SOx),
        volatile organic compounds (VOCs), heavy metals, particulate matter, and
        chlorofluorocarbons. The category does not include GHG emissions, which
        are addressed in a separate category.<p>The category falls under the
        following Pillar and Dimension </p><p>**Pillar** -
        Environmental</p><p>**Dimension** - Environment </p>|

        |**BusinessEthics**|**Business Ethics** - The category addresses the

        ethical conduct of business, including fraud, corruption, bribery and
        facilitation payments, fiduciary responsibilities, and other behavior
        that may have an ethical component. This includes sensitivity to
        business norms and standards as they shift over time, jurisdiction, and
        culture. It addresses the company's ability to provide services that
        satisfy the highest professional and ethical standards of the industry,
        which means to avoid conflicts of interest, misrepresentation, bias, and
        negligence through training employees adequately and implementing
        policies and procedures to ensure employees provide services free from
        bias and error.<p>The category falls under the following Pillar and

        ### Truvalue Fields

        |**Truvalue Fields Inputs**|**Description**|

        |---|---|

        |**TOPLEVEL**| This category represents a comprehensive overview of a
        company's Truvalue Score by integrating two key perspectives:
        ALLCATEGORIES and MATERIALITY.|

        ||**ALLCATEGORIES**  represents a company's overall Truvalue Score for
        the specific 'scoreType'. This value is equal to the cumulative average
        of all 26 SASB categories for the specific 'scoreType'. **Note** that
        category is not available for the Dynamic Materiality 'scoreType'.

        ||**MATERIALITY**  represents a composite score of all 'material' SASB
        categories for the given entity.|

        |**PILLARS**| Pillars are high-level categorizations of **Environmental,
        Social, and Governance** factors used to organize and group the 26 SASB
        categories. The three main pillars are Environmental, Social, and
        Governance. Each pillar encompasses several SASB categories that are
        thematically related. Pillars provide a broad framework for
        understanding and assessing a company's SASB performance and risks
        across these three fundamental areas.|

        |**DIMENSIONS**|Dimensions offer a more nuanced classification system
        for the 26 SASB categories, breaking them down into five distinct areas:
        **Environment, Business Model and Innovation, Human Capital, Leadership
        and Governance, and Social Capital**. This framework provides a more
        detailed and comprehensive view of a company's sustainability related
        activities, allowing for a more granular analysis of performance and
        risk across these five key dimensions of business operations and
        impact.|

        |**SASBCATEGORIES**| The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board
        (SASB) has developed a comprehensive set of 26 sustainability-related
        business topics, often referred to as general sustainability issues.
        These categories are integral to SASB's Materiality Map, which
        identifies the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) issues most
        likely to be material for companies across different industries. The
        categories span crucial areas such as Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Air
        Quality, Energy Management, Water and Waste Management, Ecological
        Impacts, Human Rights, Labor Practices, Product Safety, Data Security,
        Business Ethics, and Systemic Risk Management, among others. Each
        category is crafted to capture specific sustainability risks and
        opportunities that may impact a company's financial condition, operating
        performance, or risk profile. By providing a standardized framework and
        leveraging the Materiality Map, SASB facilitates more effective
        communication between companies and investors regarding the
        sustainability matters most pertinent to financial performance. |
